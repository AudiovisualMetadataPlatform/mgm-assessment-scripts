to me what the hell gone on and so i undressed myself to them warning out then dunno was going on in the ring i'm summarizing here i had a bin he's evil b when the results are concerned not only young people who consider to be on the left there is such a thing young vivo that process of political opinion and the thing that concerns them was the war i am they were making a more fares dude in a cage they're concerned and in many cases there is going for what was happening in vietnam told them that they have every reason to be proud of the students and they and academic community of indiana university this was bombed as a summer i didn't and silence giving a gym brings dunno haven't and those of question and answer period all fallen off why should that also add that i stated there was a policy agreed upon by the administration that the university would remain open which mccain bet those students who did not wish to expand and who felt some wall the engine to go off and do something else be a demonstrate go back to their hometowns go there elected representatives other friends and so on we're free to do so and and it's a that in those visions bob i was mention question that uses the unfortunate and being stations was the question would you under any circumstances close the universe and my answer to that was not that after i i can remember only entered huge money may him guess her by that i would certainly close the university on my own initiative if i fell off the lions studios five building or citizens we're in danger meyer any activity or if there were threat hell or possibilities of brave damage to property now that here's what i say gonna give back to it it was reported in one paper now why i didn't that is in fact not verbatim repairs i normally live with that is what i'm saying now let me get on to the second part of my statement as i know that you will have a lot of question to which to raise five i feel my obligation the responsibility riot educational opportunity and in the classroom for those teams who wish do not feel therefore when i controls the university cause these students which to attend classes there are many thousand pay their fees and have every right bag that would be paid for they will get it's their bag they wanna do to richmond said up to do and that's mildly patient on the other hand or how on the other day i do not feel those duties who out of reasons of conscience wish to go out and do something else providing it is not interfere the rights of others to do their thing shouldn't anyway be interfered with and so long hands they do not interfere the rights of others to do their thing they owe him using yeah hands much the obligation of university those we're going bingham as it is to prevent those ten class a half and uncertain we are by the mob the new building top five gave my comment votes of the brave easily relate logically general attitude relating so initially the stone government demands affirmative

president of this universe it made a statement indy have this university dating kind of urgency asian i would've moved to center alamo give a damn simple reason these are quite as president to preside over the educational policy not to make statements of those others on the bible the war among the students with relation before thoughts like a house we all that view of well only as a corporate body concerned with scholarship and work jim is different it has a lot because a large number of alternate diesel one that's demonstration but all kinds of matters which relate like timid not as a

you can condom use you oh what's the use the last bloomington council this this this policy is decided the last going to have this meeting bloomington fact i'm a council took action they made a recommendation to finally have la i am our mouth i do not friends i'm a nation and as a matter of fact why uniforms when five give him a tradition so i have known now fans are higher you the details you online didn't show it in lead ah right that was fast was a resolution the urge having ah a serious attention of finding me by which students with lots of foreign to academic penalties that's going back higher ones of what the top options on this or not then then the faculty various divisions the willing to share those kinds of rule patterns on parts of that money college of arts and sciences policy committee as i understand what you made we know this been at school faculty good to meet on this that tomato values alternatives but i think you might get different things developed in devon lives obviously the incomplete is one with that demolition but it's easy to do for an instructor some passed by our religion chips about they are various option but gears up to the individual faculty member two weeks the recommendations which i'm going because writing practices are we are all was tied with the individual faculty member ah doctor was needed that's a belief to question so i guess and the first one has to do with non violent and i like to know who's responsible for court how how we have we're vulgar that someone drugs didn't know my nerve to call the police on this whoa i know how i i lots huh huh did because i'm prison so if a kid we can we let it's what i mean me i there is racism it though really for bows to headed to the pros well known that rosen's of uniform off sir soon to incite can we get it off with life the the blues what the goal get on for just this reason you'll give me insurance man i don't get you to get all you want to but if you prevent people going about friends and do not allow them to it is hannah dr patiently waited far several hours and don't think isn't gonna don have some bad play and you weren't there the year the others were requested to placate the norway's and for i am too old and foam move on and woven pick chat the lions what a of yours i am i let's say that do with world to see for the year ago the us is science committee of the division was as i understand which to report in favre of position that nobody should be given for all to see you are tests sad lol university kelso up to me was a ploy designer stand by by yourself damn about your goal one of looking at in our universe began committee was a point and i haven't maybe has boehner report you five you have access to the filings the committee which i do andy a year that report on the five accounts overs incineration recommendation in the recommendation wasn't i don't know the details two one olives they left up to the right one what about that fantasy that so what what the arts and sciences or the ago ah did not then you know that it won't be easy why did was delayed the recommendation of the five of the of the college of arts and science that why opinion on indies these should not thou than that to this tuesday and then then the last in within the college of arts best place to them the same category as some of the other horses and professionals pools pilot could be tightened up then the maximum allowed by the college of arts and not propose in the immediate ending of that and you have some random proposals that aren't easy ah where'd the venues or repair it was that on on the rusty the money because obviously is robert not only that college boobs within the college the land and their students within the various division where's the question though released i like to know if i only i you open to public and bring sources in use why not love and white that's areas there's a public accounting all university use of times made to the state of indiana and those become public documents is and therefore awful in my head that definition i then in the eyes dominoes stay here huh huh huh foundation by phone most time the institution han the or or oh i am a i'm a christening use of the school the these are not ordinary times is and i don't think the ordinary responses from the administrating are appropriate a half the collision with indiana university finds itself in today the man's extraordinary spots i made tons of of iraq was a regularly that i do not what closed wines that his eyes were not live this morning we would not be there today a hat f now the money you read the bill is due this morning that i own is a which was so i live without many of you many of you read rather than the trial for the recommendation they was the recommendation why lee the yale going with elements why does the second he was given being alive the virtual got yesterday they all have you read this to this morning that opportunity is it do not believe because of like the ingrained civil libertarian present having lived in the south for many years do not believe in a while majority rule to believe preservation lights the minority and i don't think that the university should be closed down off you existed those who want it that way good well i've been huge but just saying beijing has made a mess of the war you will attempt to protect the rights of those who don't agree is not enough huh how i understand completely that the you know that you receive as vision cannot were the faculty to do anything i don't have any other way i think they can clearly make their feelings known that they agree the recommendation to each individual school to each individual school out of ammo anyway bases to allow them to us when i bought a community pool and then i think was right lobby of our own way your good two more constructive things during the next three weeks and take exams to do so and it should be ugly a recommendation from will the president chancellor that classes will be waived they of what we waved and credit will be given automatically how how do not believe in the productivity of interfering with the rights of those who sometimes are very sound pragmatic reason here are great for small it's even to themselves or to others be able to gain glancing saying and but i think that the university is an obligation in the broadest possible context of what's been going on a country in the last ten days see this as an extraordinary step perhaps but as of early my ears when we consider the alternative devon obligation to say yes while i would not ordinarily do so these are extraordinary times and i recommend to the end the other side leaders i had app i live is it i haven't had to go out of this man with him on heat demand years in the airports resign as good as last year because it was medically on just about him and is better than than that of the net class and he's a member of the events we've got a reply like i thought i did thought i'd already said one of my judgment go back home and at home town i personally favor do it and asian in the direction which is didn't i think this was comments i'm sorry what urgent one of the little busy would insist there's a real been awesome dominate about the studies were a rest and then continues to thorn wars a dollar be open and i just came from jail he blew rest of our time they fit they have been a rainbow dollars with released and fifty dollars bail peace four dollars the bail money was raised by the faculty huh how if one very important what about this none that's only because without conditions foreigners thomas thirty seven from the prisons he hates to lose in court now on and thomas are much concerned that you'll know that the judge made the effort i mean is what seriously to sit advances most awesome where are you could've been a five hundred thousand was the dia that there is going to be some are super patients to this from our part that in other words the implication was quite clear that the boy's gonna be tonight the bars before long run huh we ended that meant to say is blaze five hundred dollars apiece for number of students from so i you'll keep this in mind how i we got the money that's the aids and we would collect them and infinity six thousand eighty stuff ah and that out it would be divisions was that isn't a brown about says oh is that i didn't mind it is good to be used again there was like nine one one thousand about the teaching and nine seven pm right here in an auditorium in mainz because v the dan ms
