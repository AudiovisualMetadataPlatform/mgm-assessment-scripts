ah i'm going to put the white on here the like e. ah have we all know we provision we define couldn't fix that ah terms of a wild with college in terms of the i'm honored great point average or are you one of the woman will kind of law ah having courses and finishing degree program ah and i've you will look at a high level we've deployed and firms of receiving honors various fines and then after college we look at success in terms of such things as entry to graduate cool war perhaps what kind of graduates warrior able to enter how we leave it is or or whether we get a job and effect we aw what kind of job man he how much it pays burning of the news in many cases says measures of success when offense these are all ah when one way or another visual academic measures were vocational measure ah earnings for example with like it is probably the grove want to sample the tv yea ah the post college of of worms things are all connected academic and vocational measures of success now the promise of mine op was afternoon is that while there's nothing inherently wrong or simple about these traditional measures ah they are and we nah nah and if we persist in winking are conception of students fix that we're limiting our investment and accept that way we're selling the war not only our institutions and our students but also to find work we got 'em wayne why i believe so there is mounting evidence that the quality of civic why so they can be a human in the nineties bates vinny roving in recent years full of problems along i know one of waiver of that for me this review mention of view of the things katie race relations growing economic disparity that woody dario was hey inner cities a few carrier rating infrastructure all weakening public cool of them and you're responsible mass media whining civic engagement and the increasing enough in the increasing affect the excuse that the that the briefing of active of government all the names of the few have them walk or a few course citizen a human from politics and are wrong you affected nerves not only go hand in hand one also cripple our capacity the educate each new generation of leaders and government lol that's a forty another route imperfections sent our colleges and universities educate each new generation of weir's in these the olds her train all personnel who teach the entire population collegiate level we'll hire a cage community but there are some responsibility are these the file problems service so much apparently our graduates are not successful or not in these other areas it began this all the social problem indeed they have become a part of bravo and considering that are higher education system is generally regarded it minus one of the world we need a half ourselves where have we gone wrong the more i reflect on the problems confronting fire education larger society the more i become convinced part of the problems in trying to look back positive social change is a question op will we and love you v the night hello i this for my current preoccupation by this i mean not only are bullies about what to the success means but althorp a week about the meaning in purpose of what we're like occasion and our view of our view of the role of fire education should play in large fine this speak up fast means very little and make will fan unless we also conveyor the issue why yeah in other words our beliefs about things except for closely by warble weeks about the purpose of education and roll pirate occasion in the society promise not to vote or weeks about these matters but also that these bullies remain largely on examined and on expose while we just got a debate the educational policies and practices emanate from why we are educating arts youths to do with the relationship we hire education and society hold very different views about this relationship and it's important that we bows no idea why and recognize connor youths an extreme view which would probably be indoors by only lol overall arc or panic the lead of perhaps robert repercussions is that the university should remain wall law from the x. er world record what they are is students come wounds body on the spur by world leaders fractions yeah i would call live the thought i read our you didn't we're all about calm now the ivory tower concept my data for fuel of the over some of my academic colleagues my most of the final you would have agreed you feel not and never will represent viable reception ah hire a few asian and it's role in modern american society white or not i urge occasion you fuck your society sanctioned and supported by that society has in turn what does though or that the society univision favorite food outlaw of another public pronouncements in other words we're sort of on on the whole a year in our rhetoric an alternative always have them which seems to dominate in discussions of educational popping these days why or have cured of we like to call take the word you i love trying to do one or the peg board views don't success is jack in terms of how her prepares to give for work they warned you also that is what drives what i like to call the the competitiveness argument thought put these up your together because they they are wins tom this is the dominant belief not only over captives our captains of industry but also most politicians and policy makers not to mention men and teachers in there the idea here is the fire education off the web or more people were back science technology in modern management techniques so that america's economy can remain competitive with the economies of western europe especially with the emerging economies on the pacific rim my main problem with a peg board and content and competitiveness used their their representatives mainly limited john not only of a role pirate occasion but also the larger society of all about when we consider the major problems whiting hearts of five it's very difficult to a mansion fall they were view of the competitive you you'd you'd much we get ill job while the waiver market certainly is not and do the trick when i come dealing with robin hood is art paying your studies to our racial problems to the inequities in the dispute well im four now a close one of the paperwork to while like to call the private economic benefit you were the consumer point about what we're all and it it could take your viewpoint argues that corpus of fire education it is two enable people to read more out what part of why and a lot of politicians like every take this view of of all populace you are the easier well the more education you get what you can make and even rash alive her of a productive of these argument that you do with productivity there even if we ignore to accept the of argument that private economic benefit by the main gov farrar existence as education was visions you were bullies the fun of it mainly limited because it has level of play about how society as a whole is served by foot rub in other words why they feel wobble goal contribute to the economic com for him well being of those citizens were fortune off cameron can we hire education point have little to say about what's gonna happen with people don't go to college college north of those a site anything about how but all the many other social economic problems that i've mentioned earlier will be a draft an entirely different kind of leaves islam isn't why in the various public pronouncements that i bore you with two remake in ar that wall of the presidential they have a college reports and so forth in many ways the sometimes walking statement commas post anything john believes conception of a proper role that they and society if we were just i mean the mission statement but in fact we love our brightest of bonus ah the mission statement or randomly selected group of american hired visions we would sell them now for find a mansion private economic benefits international better fillings walk in the labor market on the contrary weapons that is writing it's educational mention that the bubble call him a person will use such language and pairing fins are responsible for this and you developing characters developing future leaders caring for the for society so wall in other words were double weave our own rhetoric those of us who were in the academy see ourselves and serving fine anna promoting in strengthening our particular form of them are rather sell them we might we for them have the this can ship for this concept of our mission profitable we system does not preclude individual economic benefits or the wings walk away for market or advancing economic competitiveness the central focus he is on responsible the service and ship you buy would argue him quiet much rocker things that moves you success then do the other view clearly the manner in which we approach this issue of students successful that can have a week on which of the people weeks we weren't sex act why is one thing if we see ourselves that we as helping young people believe we're comfortable with our own lives quite another thing if we see ourselves to working together in our society in our democracy given the current state of our democracy in our society i would argue we have no voice two ways you problem worse is that if you look at the owner in college or university rectum and is overrated king and personnel practices and the values that government administrative policies very difficult wine much elements about war commitment of the rings movies for responsible citizenship most of visions that's simply not good bear citizenship and service and that month and the practice spike of growing interest in service and civic engagement within the academy in this about very healthy devolve of things to me there's a lot more we can do to review and revitalize gage one and democracy in the us in the classroom for example we can start getting more attention the development of those qualities crucial to civic why demographic government and by defining qualities such a soulful understand you know that's i knew at the base of all we all thought it would have where is it you never recover i'm whining understanding what feelings feel leadership they ah nothing generosity though the ability to work all i ever would most of these qualities exemplify aspect of what daniel goleman would lol a motion all intelligent we can also began to emerge as the concept of civic responsibility of the ship in the back of the discussions of correct you read war in our collective discussions would be easy to justify given the fact of life that have a lot of missions they control all of that iran or and given some very promising current developments in the correct york area and i'm thinking here of the of the song multicultural was on the environment is this two examples can also build on these efforts finer to sing general education content more directly on issues re americans of it like a mockery well i mean by this the central role of information and the mass media theory of the mock that you ignore them or like her about war one of the map media are exactly without problems of the failure possible causes of the whining civic engagement and be climbing often government the escalating role of money in politics the growing corporate influence goal that along with these no we give you much more to institutionalize service farming both in the general education curriculum and major i think we should all this and those who complain wiring service the measures that all i can say is do we do manage english comp by requiring a billy ah we require what we value though we make a value statement when we require something with him what i really suggest thing here is a weekend began to broaden our conception of student success oh include genuine commitment of our opinions fusion to run knowing seven white and civic engagement in american society and we can manifest that commitment by embracing significant changes are correct a lot reward system community relations and most importantly in the value of bullied guide our policies are active i my man here that are narrow definition of student success is in many ways parallel who are narrow road finding probably success in the research universities hey what service the the importance of teaching mentoring in universities are fact is probably success is that fine nearly it's was that we in many places in terms of research and scholarship by the fall porn back a week now good college which are so critical of creating a real academic community get little or no wind judging the perfect fit that are calling in my path lecture tuesday evening i just got for traditional bullies about what makes our institutions actual one and er give me for being myself with are a lot more people here have live though we've either refresh you buy your memory and of course a cough or in the family so no wide reaching of want more five most of us the finer right ones in terms either about there are the resources that we haven't i've got a new charger you guys you're you're leaving way of getting one thing about this well we define a rack once in terms of what we have and what others think of it is is love when i recall being egocentric approach whining at once in the end and while while we're if nothing inherently wrong we have every force was the one thing we have to have reputations to attract and back when ah when we concentrate on movies at the end condition or act one we again the manage and and the value ah you were ah and as i argued tuesday night that what we really need to work as a concept of back once based on how active we were able educate our students but effectiveness and gives it that being seen in much broader for sorry about the reputation when ross forces conception is that they fail to address directly basic the final purpose public servants we don't need these resource of reputation paradoxically it can also cause or or or neglect our report with the irony of it that would be calm or focus on a wire ring refer now on then in nurturing and evolving research now before either go round bob every all or most in the wall problems in academia i would argue can be found in this preoccupation with resource and reputation all fun and when he does we reviewed they're familiar all and yet we don't normally think about them in terms how they are right bob are we fifteen about what makes the fact for example the valuing of research over teaching and this bravo between equity in fact one and the issue of individualism courses community are all in one way or another connected were bullies about the importance wiring more resources enhancing our reputation we value research more than teaching because we believe that out banning sigh of us followers will add more to our reputation and resources that will out banning features or mentors and what we define our records in terms of the past forza the annoying students the hyphen could be the uterus a resource on the thing bevan hands of our reputation we set ourselves a backwards and direct conflict with our desire to promote educational opportunities for those groups honor society whose worse than a mother and a disadvantage finally we place the highest value on the individuals by only a complete month of our students and faculty we reinforce their competitive in individual individual think fantasies making it very good for them to develop those qualities of golf hello communities on the campus and again i need good colleague ship collaboration community service citizenship to responsibility the latter wally words for the same ones that are needed to make any democracy work if we really needed we claim that education is our central mission and still learning should be at the heart our conception of x. i like to call live the seven or or how development you ah ah where a vision of all that however even if we accept this palatable view we still only advance of the question which now on and who what i am as i can for all the ways in which are visual the weeds about that to success interfere with our ability boom proven spring and civic life american society no problem strikes me is being more important then the education of the so-called romney y'all we're on her prepares dude not by granting this issue in some gap we can began to see how it might be possible for fire education institutions not eighth of broaden our conception to the vet but also to be calm more active agents positive social change we fail to the vault more active intervention for our so-called rummy your development oops find it very difficult to make much headway in revolving some of our most social an economic problem and by this i mean on employment i live well they are help here racial mansions the mount distribution of wealth the thing that can be a human from the political process i say this for speak of honor prepares things aren't they have historically been the ones most likely drop out of at any level of education and second because persons with relatively low levels of it what feynman account for this for work number welfare recipients reason inmates for people on avoid it hulu don't blow be honest the issue of race relations in affirmative action are into poli connected to the issue wonder preparation we've created a competitive hierarchical come we're waiting on the basis of measures you would like him with a fascinated with g p a in the past wars part two largest racial minority groups that competitive disadvantage if our educational system allocates resources or equitably croft these various groups and on again race measures there'd be a little leave harmony back goes without saying that the honor prepares to have a kind of a riot or higher education and some other reasons are obvious since most of us fully there at once depends on rolling more and more very fast for parents students to admit one of her parents do this with pose a real threat or a sense of x. wants why would a nice saying institution wanna do this when i hear a public officials encounter a bit of of a while the law in many states week wires that waste someone for parents to be given an opportunity to pursue post secondary education how can this be gone so we'll are at once rev the afterwards is that we've created a fire or off with where are the least well compared to these arkansas ain't even the community colleges for relatively non selective public colleges and one selective institution fine themselves force to admit you wonder who very good news the main thing competitiveness division one i am lives and leona very nobody moron or third then division one eight revenue sports athletes they like wives avoid having like contact with the students by hiring hard time boomers in part time instructors me out by you work these tracking practices exert ace so what powerful influence on the attitudes and beliefs art films and indeed of a larger society we're probably gonna be influenced much more by what we do in our admissions process for example then by what we say about but things are the quality of opportunity or multiculturalism already by practicing selective admissions using these now we define measures student success we're sending important value messages don't value the education of the students hello or school or work and we senate massive our way to our own students but also two the remedial students who we reject to those who was teach them the larger society no wonder the teaching honor for parents didn't give you the farm where we're off on important and many of the things the meaning why oh why no one who prepares students make up the one comparable it suggests that there are more difficult if he we they are and of their presence on campus once or are they are deeper reason while our beliefs about student success in the importance of resource acquisition and reputation on him early copy us and see these o'connell of every better there are other bullies harper as academics and it tremendous effect or lack of food that are largely on a knowledge live reddit we examined while evil weed give me a buzz you read why chronicle verification fire rate on those ah one of these bullies i like to characterize the importance being more now this may sound weapon while i think if you think about for a while for the queen terms of your of your pick variants in nor any other ah perhaps a few will of what i mean in many other terms like the youths market it rolling in creativity intelligence so they're all you are more open term my many years of a scholar fire education is waiver for converting not like that one convinces me that much of our beer or a meal fins and much of our willingness to get involved in educating them and the trade who are on critical of acceptance of those bullies the most of us are not even caught you wear power and love it what most of us clearly favor arthritis and not only in admissions but in the war financial way and also on the classroom right spoons and roll or institutions and take our classes dennis reflect well on our own brightness truly we love these were the first two years of war but at parsons are not so smart then if we bike poorly on us this may help books point why so many academics keep a very close by on the average fast words of the in ring freshman good for getting smarter and we're review work about our own smart but if they're getting dumber so far only smart this is rad no wonder we hire others to teach rubio students or simply avoid them altogether and what it meant the real problem here is that we value being smart more than we do evolving more pets before we went was largely unconscious preoccupation with being smart we forget that or institutions primary mission is to develop new wife will for these and other capacities of our students not really that select and survive those as a white hole pounds are all when the role well though finally come through reactivating with being smart is also part of the reason why we continue to use measures of student success the g p a and there are guys that were that are geared for ranking in ratings goodness rather than a rough one thing how much they're actually were we all know students to get a summer courses within about a half or even weren't watch they were or a smart brief right webber when they came to us and they're able to get to work plan ah party suggested that life is fitted with a standardized test why a very narrow standard ups more but there are also of little value you're in helping students to lower already helping a fool of value wait the success of our pedagogical ever we we same with normative of growth setting students on the lower school five the politicians in the public now you got your weight quality of these schools simply on the basis of which ones have marcus goons rather than on the basis of which ones are the most effective educationally and i mean if affected even terms of of now standard of more this approach not only does violence the wonderful diversity of student pounds by forcing them all into a single continuum but it also also have the effect sending a message the relatively lows warnings dude your dog you're lazy you're not college material no wonder so many students drop out of the educational system were they ever read holiday the simplest a yardstick like the f a b or the a c e a op yes used by many of us yes the rifle indicator of the students ability years are are worth more as by doing this we implicitly to manage great social one call per one or of the citizens to pounce i've mentioned such as so understanding honest the responsibility leadership and the goal you work wire for i might add here that this narrow road to the whining in assessing how one or merits for and against us with so thick that by the opponent of affirmative action thing you'll be very difficult to challenge these visual notions about and success an education wife wants know what we do with all like you would while american college the universities can be justifiably proud of the er worse than the inner autonomy collection of three thousand is illusions doing your individual things that not necessarily make oracle urine or affective system problem is not that we're all so wonderfully different and diverse but rather that the sum of all of our individual on were made it efforts doesn't always have a pool meaningful all why are really asking here if if we're gonna present and the whining our eyes so we in institutional firms for all we have the wallowing wallet money to buy make wait what i mean by this the less you can sit down together and collectively began to this that's our systems responsibilities work was fine our efforts to be compact one as individuals visions will continue that war our efforts gee real educational at once nothing else banned it in for institutional conversation about the issues that and mentioning your episodes of law would make it clear all of us and fire education i mention wrath of society have i have these right in broadening our conception of to fix in in redefining concept of what makes us back for an in with a killer on the priority that we lost the flying the effective education of the honor prepares than the local level we have that down together off five institutions and be in a serious discussion our mutual him though stop ruby asian and on her preparation these institutional conversations but also cover a number of other related issues that cry out of collaborative effort coordination it and nothing in the service service warning for a whim community needs will cover mouth problem diversity in multicultural was sharing of resources admissions france for granted so we're the one that cries out of the honor for feared we're reveals dude the necessity for optimal weight were purely competitive an individualistic mind set for our institution got more vocal wire for work and foretold road to the findings to the success pinned to the other reparation problem and where are we consider what might happen one of us with vida go along as long as it ever caught universities in this hey can you not operate independently and the first offender provisional for weeks about act fun in the case of my new outside right thing the region ten region any institution automatically put it wants raf video while we five the broad of a faction of success and to admit that we greater numbers of honor prepares to four to one bath and we're more mature sources and educating but we get the successful ones been awaiting a kind of thousands discussions of these issues i'm in beijing here the conversation with soon began on the various arguments traditionally used to that than what the mission for example afraid we use the fans give a while like the fall the can argue now for them not to overproduction argument says that we defend the use of now row conceptions of student our six bath the n f four on the ground they forget four months call and the day to work there production is laughable i feel that they do per day is on the nile k now on madden what would happen if our medical help yours is worth a frame of rope admission often and i draw parallels you're between madison in healthcare on one minute one the other because we're all using in baffle em walz in a production argument makes found in the face of a business trying to compete with other businesses there was a higher that alan white that now what some clothes the involve vision this model we gov make man for education and i think bio of rain of the matter why a lot you can see what i mean that wonder that have both of them we would have a large number off of one ever wonder wonder that are poorly that video for pathologies and it involves factor right we were down half of war room when it's awful that would now ah there are a full even better paid captain go for it to admit op lol moderately of your home banana and out of small group of the week when i flew off the walls with that a bath reigns that and all of that in most modern weapons which admitted only patients with common call now would make a lot of fatima help years of what what civic interests or or by concentrating the least walk for parents goons unions divisions with the least force how can a fighter range would be rationalized in terms of a larger interests of the community of the fire the matter is hey to see why this is so we can again you've announced he met and ah i think in the case of of of medicine we would create call on the masses a number on and reid are poorly treated wall who would then cars off two go wrong you will trying to rehabilitate ah they would be capable of working families would break up they go growth on a pay for there are a treatment on a private places info worth so seems to me that in just the same way that not valuing the education of the other perks fun by the way we've got korea yeah work creative think rob worth all later on now we talk more with the freedom forum whining fitness effect and and wanting the problem longer preparation it's important even mind their wages source maybe the students themselves probably no water room it's better suited to ring on her parents students then there are better for parent here inside her to going to be to open up the curriculum of systematic fashion everyone with them more pedagogical resources would be invested in the education of the honor for error and a better for her to do things without opportunity to master course material greater depth kenya the author divide them up on the zero you today i don't think i'd get over changed who knows who don't know what i know maybe i found wow it's such a mentoring incoming program works and it's a link with a variety of service warning opportunities for example for students to work with curtains in the public colts bond between higher education in a local community would be great problems that are plaguing market every democracy are in many respects same problems that the photo like a five more than a century and a half ago and that is the engine clean individualism and community and if get out at the institutional level byron the visual competitiveness west greater act you wanna move up affecting were and they end up with others that this tension is exacerbated by this unbelievably are independent call and suffer from each other even our most god the night highlights the importance of community single most important the influence on the individuals than turns out to be you are in light of the reduced bonding in other wreck for factors that we are very thing today you know it angel their ass do we have the wherewithal to undertake the kind of new ventures i've been suggestions that in our case the man that there are caves the defend ourselves against for rats we're a whiner forget the autonomy that we figure for that maybe the most powerful cool what we have for reshaping our notions than success and institutional act for more in the direction of promoting democracy and citizenship there's nobody standing in our way of doing this ourselves it remains in the lobby and forget that we still retain control we're practically all with visions really matter whom do with them and how to admit them then what worked wire of our students what if he how the teacher how we of fatima value where students how we define their six how we structure our co worker for rain how we hire rewarding and your colleagues all of these and percy use we used to govern ourselves in what that matter jews in our reserve in closing i'd like to emphasize once more then how we define fix and how we define at once is really a matter or values we the initial chat for academia at this point is not so much to abandon or change the youth traditional beliefs we could be calm more conscious of and there are back our policies and practices are professional why it's one thing to i'm grateful weeks that don't serve us well quite another to be largely unaware of their influence in our law kind of reflected the inquiry into our values and leaves is for we needed in academia past few years we've been working with a group of academics profit on three to explore issues related demeaning church while in academic work what we found the spike all that wayne's that we are objective callers many indeed both of us walk talk about we don't have any use to have the opportunity problem is that academic institutions as concrete structure you such opportunities are these conversations around values and beliefs and many of for richer believe in open inquiry and foremost fell values and beliefs who are narrow road finding student success or preoccupation with a wiring resources enhancing reputation being smart being seen by others is smart have affected practically everything we do and many of these effects on parade not only were best interest dammit but also the educational mission our institutional larger society we need to be in a serious discussion of wind river system defining success so now when and why we've come to worship merely being smart as opposed to the value thought things were and we need to consider our concept of smartness so vivid and compass is many of those qualities that promotes why and social responsibility five discussions and reflections long was certainly serve us well not only in our efforts meaningful we formed in our group that educating and repaired students educating students in general for greater civic responsibility but also who work the fire believe more authentic wives reba how up add what so not lol well that you will love with it was more breath it and yet or no the
