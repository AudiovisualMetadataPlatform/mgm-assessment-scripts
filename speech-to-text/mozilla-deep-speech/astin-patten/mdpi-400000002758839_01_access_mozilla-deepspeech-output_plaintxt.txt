right o ka um i'm going to put the light on here so i can see ah as we all know we traditionally define students success up in terms what willessness college in terms of the time honored great point average or if we want to do a minimal kind of umgona success passing courses and finishing a degree program ah and i if you want to look at it at high level we declined it in terms of a receding honours of various kinds and then after college ah we look at success in terms of such things as entry to graduate school or or perhaps of what kind of graduate school your able to enter how elated is or whether we get a job and especially of what kind of job and indeed how much it pass earning said the used in many cases as measures of success but in a sense esora ah when one way er another traditional academic measures or vocational measures ah and earning for example is a sasiaty the equivalent in a sense of the g p m the post college equivalent so for some things are all connected academic and vocational ah a measure of success now the promise of my taught this afternoon is it lilleston inherently wrong or simple about these traditional measures am they are simply not enough and if we presistently our conception of students success or limiting our conception of students excess in this way we are selling short not only our institutions and our students but also the society that supports us when we troopin why i believe this is so there is mounting evidence that the quality of civic life and sidicinian in the united states has been a roding and recent years allister is a long one and i don't want to believe it but when he just review of mention a few of these things shaky race relations growing economic disparities and an equities exceptive materialism detain in er cities a deteriorating inferreth a weakening public schools totem an irresponsible mass media declining titienses and the increasing in in the increasing effect i excuse fiftyseven of activeness of governmental agencies and people the names suffused in a democracy of course citizen disengagement from politics and government in effectiveness not only go hand in hand but also cripple or capacity to educate each generation of leaders in government business a law medicine the clergy and other advance professions since our colleges and universities educate each new generation of leaders in these steels and trainante personnel who teach the entire pottleton at the free calligan level we in the higher education community must bear some responsibility for these social problems that the surface so much apparently are graduates are not successful enough in these other areas to begin to solve these social problems and indeed may have become a part of the problem and considering that our higher education system is generally regarded as the finest one in the world we need to ask ourselves where have we gone wrong the more i reflect on the problem confronting higher education of the larger society the more i become convinced that at the heart of these problems in trying to effect positive social change is a question of belief and as those viewed me to see night in eleithias of my current preoccupation by this i mean not only our belief about what students success means but also are beliefs about the meaning and purpose of a liberal education and are vieweth role of that higher eddication should play in the larger society suspeck of success means very little and makes little sense in less we also consider the issue of success to what end in other words are beliefs about studentes or closely tied to our beliefs about the purposes of education and the roll of higher education in the society the problems not just with our beliefs about these matters but also that these beliefs remained largely unexamined and unexposed while we discuss and debate the educational policies and practices that emanate from them why we are educating our students has to do with the relationship between higher education and society but different people hold very different views about this relationship in its importance that we expose and identify and recognize and honor these different views and extreme view which would probably be indorsed by only a small number of hard core academic ellida such as perhaps robert made or hutchins is that the university should remain walled off from the external world of pratical affairs so students can learn and study and faculty can pursuit truth undisturbed by worldly distractions and i would call is the the ivory tower of view of what were all about um now the iracoson might have a certain peal a peal for some of my academic colleagues and i must admit i know a few for whom it has a great deal of appeal it could not and never will represent a viable conception of higher education and its role in modern american society like it or not irusian is a creature of society is sanctioned and supported by that society and had in turn pledged itself to serve that society in its mission statements in its catalogues and other public pronouncements other words were sort of un on the hook here in our rhetoric and alturnative beliefs system which seems to dominate in discussions of educational policy these days is what i perhaps in charitably like the call the pig board view cove up overarsing to do under the hagborg view student success is judged in terms of how capreae the student is for work the pegowis ah is what drives what i like to call a the the competitiveness argument a tooties up here together at because they they are twins um this is the dominant belief system not only of our captives a ocations of industry but also of most politicians and policy makers not dimention many students teachers and parents the idea here is a direction must deliver more people with expert ease and science technology in modern management techniques so that america's economy can remain competitive with the economies of western europe and especially with the emerging economies on the pacific rim by main problem with the peg board and competent competitiveness of use is as they represent an extremely limited conception not only of the role of irenicon but also of what the larger society is all about when we consider the major problems plaguing our society it very difficult to imagine how the peg board view in the competitive is view are gone contributed much to this simply to fill job lots in the labor market certainly is not going to do the trick when it comes to dealing with problems such as are decaying in her cities too are a racial problems to the inequities in the distribution of wealth and so forth now a close cousin of the pagod view is what i like to call the private economic benefit view where the consumer viewpoint about what were all about and the disparture view point argues that the purpose of fire education is to enable people to lead more affluent in comfortable lives in a lot of politicians like the advocates ututa populace to view as a cat where the more education you get the more money you can make and even rascalis it in terms of a productivity of a orgement avendo with the productivity to even if we were to accept the aparment that private economic benefits provide the main justification for our existence as educational istituto this particular belief system is extremely limited because it has little to say about house society as a whole is served by such an approach in other words why it may be a lot of ado to contribute to the economic comfort and well being of those citizens who are fortunate enough set and earn complete higher education if you point has little to say about what's goin to happen to people who don't go to college or complete college nor its dessay anything about how if at all the many other social economic problems that i've mentioned earlier will be addressed by such an approach an entirely different kind of belief system is implied in the various public pronouncements that i've already alluded to the we make in our mission statements and catalogues and the presidential state of the college report and so forth in many ways these sometimes lofty statement come as close as anything that john does conception of the proper role of education in society if we were to study the mission statements in fact we from of our graduates of dun mist a the mission statements of a random we selected group of american higher education institutions we would sell them if ever find any mention of private economic benefits international competitiveness or filling slots in the labor market on the contrary when of contested describing its educational mission the typical college university will use such language as preparing students for responsible citizenship developing character developing future leaders preparing students the serves the siety and so on in other words the weardale our own rhetoric those of us who work in the academy c ourselves as serving the society and of promoting and strengthening our particular form of democratic self government we might refer to this as the citizenship or the service concept of our mission while such a belief system does not preclude in the venal economic benefits or filling slots in the labor market ah or enhancing economic competitiveness the central focus is one responsible citizenship and service the citizenship you i would argue implies a much broader conception of students success than do the other views clearly the manner in which we approach this issue of students successful depend heavily on which of these beliefs systems we embraces success implies one thing if we see ourselves simply as helping young people to lead more comfortable and affluent lives but quite another thing if we see ourselves as working together to strengthen our society in our democracy given the current state of our democracy in our society i will argue that we have no choice but to embrace this view the problem of forest is it if you look at the typical on merican college university is correct in when in its cocherel its teaching and personal practices and the values that governess administrative policies it's very difficult find much evidence of a car commitment to preparing students for responsible citizenship most institutions have simply not put their citizenship and service commitments into practise despite the growing interest in service in tatiana within the academy in this is a a very healthy development seems to me there's a lot more we can do to renew and revitalize ciecamente and democracy in the u s in the classroom for example we can start giving more attention to the development of those personal qualities which are crucial pacific life and effective democratic self government and by the sining quality such as self understanding you know that kind of at the basis of all the great full of topical in religious traditions where is it in the correctional a hard time finding it self understanding listening skills leadership amphithoe generosity the viability to work collaborative most of these qualities exemplify aspects of what daniel golden would call emotional intelligence we can also began to introduce the concept of civic responsibility in citizenship in the facile discussions of curricular reform such a shift in our curricular discussions would be easy to justify given the fact that is i said or catalogues of missions fatentes are all full of that kind of rhetoric and given some very promising current developments in the curricula area and unthinking here of the emphatic cultural ism in the environment system to examples we can also build on these efforts by introducing general education content that focus is more directly on issues of contemporary american civic life and democracy and what we mean by this the central role of information and the mass media very of democritian you ignorement the lecture oosor but i don't think he at media are exactly without problems in this area the possible causes of declining titian gagement and declining trust in government the escalating roll of money in politics the growing corporate influence and soon has a long list of these and we can do much more to institutionalized service learning both in the general education correct mum and in the major and i think we should all do this and those who complained that requiring service diminishes at all i can say is do we diminish english comfy requiring it doing ah we require what we value so we make a value statement when we require something with students what i really suggesting here is that we can begin to broaden our conception of students success to include a genuine commitment on the part of the institution to renewing civic life and civic engagement in american society and we can manifest that commitment by embracing significant changes in our curricula itching practices reward system community relations and most importantly in the values and beliefs that guide are policies in practices i might add here that are narrow definition of students success is in many ways parallel to our narrow approach the defining faculties success in the research universities we pay lips or as to the importance of teaching mentoring in university service but the fact is that the faculty success is defined nearly exclusively in many places in terms of research and polachia by default important facile talents like good college ship which are so critical to creating a real academic community get little or no wit in judging the professional success of our colleagues in my patent lecture on tuesday evening i discussed our traditional beliefs about what makes our institutions excellent and forgive me for a pen myself with your lot more people here do not a deseption at least i better refresh you will your memory and is of a course madopoor ng to fanny so i don't mind preaching at once more a most of us defineetion in terms either of of the the resources that we have and i've got a new charger for you guys who were here to the hevening his equation now i'm getting the quantitative about this ah where we define rex went on terms of what we have and what others think of him a isis a ah and what i would call the ego centric approached to define in excellence and end up and while and while there is nothing in herly wrong we have to have resources to function than we have to have reputations to attract students and faculties ah when we concentrate on these as the end as the ultimate definition of our excellence we again diminish in an endevours learning ah and as i had argued a tosenochte what we really need to move toward is a concept of excellence that they on how effectively were able to educate our students but effectiveness and students success being seen in much broader terms my concern about the reputation when resources conception is if they fail to address directly our basic social purposes of teaching in public servants not the we don't need these reveries source of reputation but paradoxically it can also poses pervert we neglect our refutation it is the irony of it because would become more focus on acquiring refertae then in nurturing in developing the research coletit's already there the roots of three of our most intractable problems in academia i would argue can be found in this preoccupation with resource acquisition in reputational enhancement when he is quickly review these as there familiar to hollis and yet we don't normally think about them in terms of how they are products of our beliefs system about what makes us excellent for example the valuing of research over teaching and the struggle between equity and excellence and the issue of individualism versus community are all in one way or another connected to her beliefs about the importance of acquiring more resources in enhancing our reputation we value research more than teaching because we believe that outstanding scientist and scholars will add more to our reputation and resources than will outstanding teachers or mental ers and when we define our expense and term of of the test scores of the entering students the high student is corrington deters a resource which i find interesting that enhances our reputation we set our sense of excellence in direct conflict with our desire to promote educational opportunities for those groups in our societies whose testor put a medico entire disadvantage finally when we placed the highest value in the individual scotty accomplishments of our students and faculty we reinforce their competitive and individuals individualistic tendencies making it very difficult for them to develop those qualities that gulp promote a sense of community on the campus and again i mean good colleague ship collaboration community service citizenship and social responsibility these latter qualities of course are the same ones that are needed to make any democracy work if we really mean it when we claim that education is our central metion then student learning should be at the heart of our conception of excellence i like the call is the civic or talent development view of ah what our mission is all about however even if we accept this talent development view we still need the answer the question which talents and who what and as i consider all the ways in which our traditional of belief about excellence and students success interfere with their ability to improve and strengthen civic life in american society no problem strikes me as being more important than the education of the so called remedial or under prepared student now by examining this issue in some depth we can begin to see how it might be possible for hiereus is to tution not egorovna conception of students access but also to become more effective agent of positive social change if we fail to develop more effective intervention for our so called remedial or developmental students will find it very difficult to make much headway in resolving some of our most pressing social and economic problems and by the tien unemployment crime well fair health care racial tensions the maldistribution of wealth and citizen disengagement from the political process i say this first because under prepared students are to have historically been the ones most likely to drop out of at any level of education and second because persons with relatively low levels of educational attainment account for a disproportion of numbers of welfare recipients prison inmates poor people the unemployed and people who don't vote beyond this the issue of race relations in affirmative action are intimately connected to the issue of underpropt since we have created a competitive hierarchical system which dispenses privilege on the basis of measures it we come again with a success natures that gip and the tescar that put our two largest racial minority groups at a competitive disadvantage if our educational system allocated its resources more equitably across these various groups by such economic and race of measures their be little need for affirmative action it goes without saying that the under prepared student is a kind of pariah in american higher education and some of the reasons are obvious since monstrous believe that are excellent depends on in rolling more and more of the very best prepared students to admit under prepared students would pose a real threat to our sense of excellence why when any sane institution one to do this but here the public institutions and counter a bit of a dilemma since the law and many states requires that at least some under prepared students be given an opportunity to pursue potecary education how can this be done so we don't put our excellence at risk the answer forest is that we've created higher eripuit systems where the least well prepared students are consigned either to community colleges or to relatively non selective public colleges and when selective institutions find themselves forced to admit a few under prepared food and for example to maintain competitiveness one division one as latins and trust me on this ere an nobody more under prepared than division one a revenue sports athletes they likewise avoid having much contact with these students by hiring part time tutors and a part time instructors from the outside to do the work these tracking practices exert a subtle but powerful influence on the attitudes and beliefs of our students and indeed of the larger society who are probably going to be influenced much more by what we do in our admissions process for example than by what we say about such things as equality of opertunity or multi cultural ism or educational equity by practicing selective admissions using these narrowly defined measures of students success were sending importance value messages we don't value the education of the students with a lower scores and we send this message not only to our own students but also to the remedial students who only reject to those who must teach them in to the larger society no wonder the teaching under prepared students is viewed as unglamorous important and a many institutions be meaning why do why do under prepare a students make us so uncomfortable if a jest that there more difficult to teach which i believe they are and that their presence on campus threatens our sense of excellence or are their deeper reasons while our beliefs about students success in the importance of resource acquisition in reputational in handman are fairly obvious we can see these upon a little bit of reflection there are other beliefs we harbor as a cademy and that have tremendous effects on our practices that are largely unacknowledged much less critically examined and one of these beliefs forgive me if those you read my chronicle of paraguatan a pirate on this am i one of these beliefs i like to characterise as the importance of being smart now this may sound flippant i think if you think about it for a while particularly in terms of your of your experience in this institution or any other ah perhaps you'll see a little of what i mean the many other terms i could use first smart as they brilliance creativity intelligence and so but for the purposes of artist cushion here all use the more flippant term smartness by many years as a scholar of hired as an employe of a reverting of risky not unlike this when convinces me that much of our fear of remedial students and much of our unwillingness to get involved in educating them can be traced to our uncritical acceptance of this belief and to the fact that most of us are not even consciously aware of the power and scope of its influence most of us clearly favor our brightest students not only in admissions but in the award of financial aid and also in the classroom if bright students and roller institutions and take our classes then this reflects well in our own brightness surely we must be smart if urstudien are so smart but i parcourant so smart down this reflects poorly on us this may help to explain why so many academics keep a very close eye on the average tesor of the entering freshman if our students are getting smarter and were reassured about our own smartness but if they're getting dumber are ten of our own smartness as threatened no wonder we hire others to teach remedial students are simply avoid them all together through selective admissions the real problem here is it we value being smart much more than we do developing smartness if a relentless and largely unconscious preoccupation would being smart we forget that our institutions primary mission is to develop new lectual capacities in other capacities of our students not merely to select and certifies those who elect ual talents are all wet rot well developed by the time they come to us this preoccupation with being smart is also part of the reason why we continue to use measures of students success the ga in the standardized test cord that are geared to ranking and writing students rather than to reflecting how much their actually learning we all know students who get as an recourses who didn't put out on the upper new demean much but they were very smart and very bright very clever when they came to his near able to get through our exams i've already suggested that these assessments devices particularly the standardized cast imply of very narrow standard of smartness but there also of little value either in helping students to learn or in helping us to evaluate the success of our pedagogical efforts we were inflicted the same normative approach to a setting students on the lower schools such the politicians and the public now evaluate the quality of these schools simply on the basis of which ones have the smartest students rather than on the bases of which ones are the most effective educationally and i mean this effected even in terms of this narrow standards of smartness this approach not only does violence to the wonderful diversity of student talent by forcing them all into a single continuum but it also it also has the effect of sending a method to the relatively low scoring student your dumb our lazy you're not college material it's no wonder so many students drop out of the educational system before they ever reach college a simplistic yard stick like the fat ear the actas used by many of us as the principal indicator of the students ability are sparanara ness but by doing this we implicitly diminish the great social and cultural importance of the citizenship calenian tioned such as empathy self understanding honesty responsibility leadership and the guy were calabria i might add here that this narrow approached the defining and c and assessing talent or merit has been turned against us with considerable success by the opponents of affirmative action i think it'll be very difficult to challenge these traditional notions about students success and education excels and less we do it collectively while american colleges universities can be justifiably proud of their diversity in their autonomy a collection of three thousand institutions simply doing their individual things does not necessarily make for a coherent or effective system the problem is not that were also wonderfully different in diverse but rather that the sum total of our individual uncoordinated efforts doesn't always add up to a meaningful hole what i really asking here is it for going to resist into finding or excellence solely in institutional terms or all we gonna be willing to bite the bullet and take a system perspective let me see if i can explain what i mean by this unless we can sit down together and collectively begin to discuss our systems responsibilities towards the society our efforts to become excellent as individualist etton will continue to thwart our efforts to achieve real educational excellence as a system if nothing else and an extended inter institutional conversation about the issues that i've been mentioning here at the systems level would make it clear that all of the entire education not to mention the rest of the society have a heavy stake in broadening arkansian of student success and in re defining our concept of what makes us excellent and in particular on the priority that we must design to the effective education of the under prepared students at the state in systems and local levels we have to sit down together all types of institutions and begin a serious discussion of our mutual and billings about remediate and under preparation these institutional conversations could also cover a number of other related issues but cry out for collaborative effort coordination and expansion of community service and service learning program community needs local governmental problems diversity in multicaulis sharing a resources admissions transfer credit and so forth but the one that cries out most urgently for attention as the under prepared were remedial student lines achinafe us to move away from a purely competitive and individualistic mind set what good for arnstein and to adopt more of a collaborative or consortia approach to defining students success into the under preparation problem becomes clearer when we consider of what might happen if one of us were definitione as long as the different casini versities in a state continued to operate in the pendent in so persist in their traditional beliefs about excellence and indicates of iuaa not to testate but a region the big ten region any institution of automatically puts its excellence at riot if it unilaterally decides to broaden its conception of success and to admit substantially greater numbers of under prepared students or to invest substantially more of its resources in educating such students if we could be successful in stimulating the kinds of systems discussions of these issues that i am envisioning here the conversation would soon begin to focus on the various arguments that we traditional used to defence elective admissions for example of frequently used to fence is what i like to call the prediction argument now to put this in a nutshell the prediction arguments says that we defend the use of of these narrow conceptions of student talent and success that dependence on the ground offahed performance in college and indeed they do project but the prediction is less than ideal but they do predict an this is undeniably the case now a magine what would happen if our medical health care system were to take the same approchoit admission policies and i draw a parallel here between medicine and health care on the one hand an education in the other because we're all as using industral analogues and their prediction arguments make sense in the case of a business that trying to compete with other businesses and on the higher the best talent to exploit that talent for its own purposes to succeed in competition but this model simply dozen make sense for education and i think biolorin this with a medical analogy conceive what i mean to do chaunter that kind of a sistem we would have a large number of hospitals and clinics that are under fundina are poorly staff that have porpoises and that in rollses patience we would down have a smaller group of instant of of cocoeni and hospitals that would have um better facilities and better paid staff and so forth which it admitted of patience with the moderate leever illnesses and then i won have a small group of the league clinic and hospitals with the best cat and vestries and all a best and most modern equipment which admitted only patience with common colds and it would make a lot of fence and the health care system what public interest what civic interest is served by concentrating the least well prepared students in the institutions with the least resources how can such an arrangement be rationalised in terms of the larger interests of the community in the society the fact of the matter is that it came to see why this is so we can again use analogy for medicine and oh i think in the case of of of medicine we would create ah a massive number of untreated or poorly treated people who would then cause us to go broke if you will trying to rehabilitate them ah they wouldn't be capable of working their families would break up they go bruttino pay for their treatment on a private basis and so forth so it seems to me that in justice same way that not valuing the education of the underpropped students by the way we structures were creating the same kind of problem for yourself later on now we took more of a system of proach to defining students success as to confronting the problem under preparation it important to keep in mind that our greatest untapestried may be the students omeless this probably no other group that better suited to tutoring under prepared students than their better for pared tears if such pertotion be built into the curriculum in assistance faction every one would benefit more pedagogueries would be invested in the education of the under prepared and the better prepared students would have an opportunity to master course material in greater depth by teaching it to others as i sat on a couple of meetings earliest day i don't think i get number teaching students houdon know what i know maybe i go i aittah a venturing in tutoring programme were expanded to include a variety of service learning opportunities for example for students to work with under prepared foods in the public schools the bonds between higher education and the local community would be greatly strengthened the problem with that are plaguing are contemporary democracy are in in in many respects the same problems that the tumble identified more than a century and a half ago and that is the tension between individualism and community and is acted out at the institutional level by our individual contentive and quest for greater excellence we want to move up in the packing order and in a push others down this tension is exacerbated by the mistaken belief that we are independent of and separate from each other even our most recreant research on students some of which i thought to bout to tynagh high lights the importance of community the single most important source of influence on the individual student turns out to be the perrot in light of the reduced funding and other external pressures that we are experiencing the day at all it seems only fair to ask do we have the wear with all to undertake the kinds of new ventures i been suggesting the afternoon in our haste to man the barricades to defend ourselves against external threats were inclined to forget that the aconomy that we seek to protect may be the most powerful pool with we have for reshaping are notions of students success and institutional excellence more in the direction of promoting democracy and citizenship there is nobody standing in our way of doing this except ourselves the factory names and it is what we tend to forget that we still retain control over practically all with a decision that really matter whom to admit and how to admit them what courses and what work to require of our students what to tich how to teach it how we affect in a valuate our students how we define their success how we structure our co coracle programs how we higher reward and tenure or colleagues what policies and procedures we used to governor selves and what subject matter we choose in our research in closing i like to emphasize once more than how we define success and how we define excellence is really a matter of our values in beliefs the initial check for academia at this point is not so much to abandon or change these traditional beliefs but simply to become more conscious of them and of their effect on our policies and practices in our professional lives it's one thing to embrace beliefs aduncate but quite another to be largely unaware of their influence in our lives this kind of reflective inquiry into our values and beliefs is sorely needed an academia for the past few years we be working with a group of academic across the country to explore issues related to meaning purpose and spirituality in academic work and what we found it despite all of the claims we are objective detached scholars many indeed most of us want talk about sesusu we don't have the venus we don't have the opportunities the problem is that i could domains the titians as currently structured offer fussach opportunities for these conversations around values and beliefs and many of the titians actively discourages i believe that an open inquiry into our most deeply felt values and beliefs of to our narrow approach to defining students success and our preoccupation with acquiring resources and enhancing reputation being smart and being seen by others as smart as effected practically everything we do and that many of these effects are contrary not only to our best interests as academics but also to the educational mission of our institution in the larger society we need to begin a serious discussion of widely presision success so narrowly and why we have come to worship merely being smart as opposed to the value of developing smartness and we need to consider our concept of smartness so that it encompasses many of those qualities that promote cieli and social responsibility such the scussion and reflections will almost certainly serve us well not only in our efforts to effect meaningful reforms in our approach to educating under prepared students and to educating students in general toward greater sitapore sponsibility but also to our desire to lead more authentic and productive lives as academics thanks very much i atasthaliaesin but gregarian her

what important and then we have some kind of collected the scotch says he went our common values are ah and i segetes of these do have to do with a alhondiga made for a fact of parents and affected so and we know it someone's are and it seems to me as water men marriott in fact at all something sounds but we do it the worry it explode or our research on susanville in that we are sigillaria a fairly well in some kinds of tuition but not necessarily as a revolt on pericofcius in continoos sort of a vicramaditya you dorian the sort of way we termination anterior to beleaguer bereavement to the mean mylingarne the crash and all i am from initiates was at the reasoner a nomination the tane the one they have a little tooooooooot masnal narramore control all along at erwaehlt dogeared but we don't have a money at all honion have a well to be as aanaware conquistadores triplanetario politeness by the heels of to a corentin and the guy to go take as is to example where we have almost free rainily to general education program to design of any way we want in fact i could pototoes university of where that responsibility for general education is tested more in the department so it is esoonian odd maybe unusual way he put it other atheist on to do this and that if certain certain um a decentralisation of the general ucation program but the point of it that sitting on collections both the concanen the teaching methods that we used in the light of this broader conception of students success might indeed lead us to make a major revisions in the crickendon no teaching technique at that so what i i have my calamitie learning for example if i and the evidence of that pre compelling and in service learning both undressed that have a seems to me obvious relevance to these issues of democracy in citizenship and in community nileboat i do what at all asesinato you have the vaeringers an interadditive airavati woreington gigantea i aeronometer were as a doyouseeaman by the naassene and had a itineraire you were so you said all i ooooooooooo determination were weaving the ototototoi tayotama samples of a very effective calabrian which is what sustain stood is all about that one model appear to ring of another model but they all capitalized on on the wind wind game aspect of this where both the a student whose teaching or tutoring and the totalitarian reception benefit from this so we literally create more educational resources by going in the direction of purchasing clabbering and ah as if there are other aspects to this sir critical as well as what a we symbolize it or insitutions when we put a high value on teaching each other when we put a high value on our best students helping the flowers through or in the case of service learning we were we put a high value on learning which includes serving others and what macrama able about about the research on this is that it appears that both colaborer ning and service learning are better forms of instruction in terms of the extent of student learning in development in as a turns out they do have positive effects both of these approaches on some of these citizenship follies i was thought about such a leadership which is tremely in hand by participating in community service as part of a court soon were how to get things none they were how to work together to abortively to make things happen and that that's a very impowering experience as well as an opportunity to really check out that theoretical course content at the house clay out in the real world it sometimes it as safe discover it bodenlos well clutched of the serenos but the umtetwa back here do you condolatory think o that the value of ten or is limited by the way that we conceive other than us it frankly but i like for me i sort of find myself biting the hand that feat me a lot you know coming from you see la and tolentini really wonder if i was the so habout some of these things if i didn't have to you now to good question ah i'm not sure it you know like the things that it wouldn't make any difference but i don't know am the problem with ten yars at the people in mosleson have it that's that's that's the problem is that our youngest most of valerable people he system professors on wood one of being assistant professor actually and any more in a researching a verse am seems like our doctahin to do that and it really i wonder about that i catonsville situation but ah so these these folks are really threatened and intimidated by the process because they don't have any protection and they really do steer their research and there cleitagora very gingerly at least that's my experience as tistefote come so i don't know ten year unfortunately has been represented as job secured in i don't think that's really was ever the intention but that seems to be the way that it's been the scene in and its connection to academic freedom seems to be largely lost but for me that the only value of tenure really is is the the protect academic freedom and whether it does i got some questions about it so myomorphia raaaaaaa tooooooooot anne and what her later i ooooooooooooo oh overseers and aeireite the thing sitooation and is there anything ooooooooooo your yelling mahawelli sighted but god be on referential ties nor sixties ah ah which shook and quite moother things that follies really don't change he can value for i much and oh i that's not what we find um but what we do find is it the source of that effect on values is not what we like to think it is i think for a lot of florison at the source of the influence is very heavily the parrot ah and as fortunately there's some measurable factory importunitate peregrinators source of influence on his students values and not a and also the service learning prince was shakeforest to study as a profound effect on certain values of commitment to for example commitment of promoting racial understanding is as strongly influenced by a participation community service a commitment to umatilla the notion of wanting to be a social change agen the sensitive make a diffrent belief is strengthened because most soodn't think they can make a goverance ah but said those who have the opportunity to hexperience the service learning i actually a strengthened der belief that they thickened erence or abandon their police the fate can i see in yethered i apologized for my kind of fumbling around the other was no light on my papers and i am militarily struggling to see my note the asiatics for that but it was tough to see em an so i can farland you timber ah but it i can't see in the back or that's what i sustento any other hands ah here's one generoustest one of the promise is in student no one to learn because there my taking advantage of the resource in all you find that you reserving yet ah that this is part of the trans i talked about on tuesday night that that the students are not the sons coming in college to day or less inclined to see the college experience for a intrinsic value that is the joy of learning and as a joy of self development in this sort of thing is eacute sod as are and yet we don't seem to have acknowledged that on the jeffcoat we do to that reality ah and i talking in in relative terms now there pointed you who are you now very inclined to get a gaseous not of mennesota and more students who who are not and that poor because the knoxes is materialism of the society by the is the eye that the reediculus is to get a better job make more money and that has to do again with these different conceptions of hirsutine you know to competitive aagent the penford view and so forth and if we embrace those you points than a porter just reinforcing these problems but ah i think the issue of engaging students who are here for instrumental reasons ah is a real challenge but we have some ways a doing it and i was a talk about some of those with tosdenni to his henikstein we mention a couple of to day collaborating is very engaging because students know their work is going to be scrutinized by their peers and they take responsibility for their fears or learning to a certain extent sainting with a community service work down in the context of of course is that there there variations paratroop affect her of bonavista trying to collaborate provide it a meaningful service to ah to others and that's very polveriera deforested to that service morning verspre impressive and factotum restoration you like it in interorganization ooroowela leavitt's i be on it beyond anybody to take one but i see in warping the weak here is a really interesting issue you is that if you don't believe you change the place that's a somepin prophesy me think about it then had much effort you're going to exert on the half of a change everton's think it's goin a word it's very interesting i believe to come to a pinpoint and i literally a shape your experience i know we think experience shakes feline but a work the other way as well you know so we behave as so that our strange will support our beliefs because if our beliefs more support of your experience we go frisian and so i painted the metai we believe we can change our institutions we can damn you do it because we have the tools i at the learning process it'll happen slowly and resistance to change efforts in an institution is the best evidence that our making progress at the power dox of resistance and a fan are joanna have bestialita me what of you sanitation
