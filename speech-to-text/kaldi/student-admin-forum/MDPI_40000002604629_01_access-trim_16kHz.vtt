00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:24.950
holds five students met with a group of administrative this morning and agreed to maintain open picket lines including the students who decide to attend classes at least access

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.800
until this meeting took place about coming off of the podium after this dave it's a coincidence at

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.980
the moderator of the second meeting professor of law

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.400
also seated on the stage the student body

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.450
my name is harry potter or i'm just a poor professor of law

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:09.860
and i hope to be able to he literally moderator for this meeting i've been on the campus of brian hall

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:21.000
since seven thirty in the morning and i know there are deep divisions among us quite frequently during the day and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.520
students were asked what their plans were instance were asked what's likely to happen i heard one response that response

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:42.280
was it is up to the individual conscience of the end of the person there's optimism or confidence in that explanation is

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.640
appealing to me i consider the more conscious to be the most legitimate source of values and actions

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:02.060
because i heard that phrase because i am committed to i too want to appeal to your moral conscience i ask that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:12.130
even though there are divisions among us i understand the feelings i last night i understand we are living in

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:22.710
a tense world i understand some of the ugliness that's occurred on campuses and in the rest of the world and i also understand that there is hope for the world but

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:33.210
there are occasions when certain differences must be set aside if there is any chance of agreement of understanding about building a better world we

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:43.580
must not lose those aspects of civilization we have dangers saw the society is set in very many ways but it is not

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:53.870
an incurable and we are gathered together today to make one manifestation of rationality we can learn more we can talk

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:04.500
we can discuss we can exchange we can build the better for we're leader use the word lather gun battles we use the word piece

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.570
we used the word people and i ask you to remember those words i ask you to convert this an occasional we can all be proud of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:25.980
first then maybe a statement my cousins saw then a statement by chancellor carter then

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:36.030
i understand the student leaders will make statements and i hope to be able to recognize people from the floor you recognize the matter how fair i want to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:46.410
be the matter how much i will want to recognize people a different views of how difficult this would be for me in a sense we must discipline ourselves in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.610
this audience i should also announce that it's the kind of meeting that we must have a time limit

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:07.000
there are issues which i don't think i can be in talk over and over again i hope that in the hour allowed an hour from the first

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.110
week are you'll be able to clarify enough let us see what happens in the hour let us breathe first that we last talked last for

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.570
an hour

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.090
but i think something as a mystery right now that this meeting so that for the students that fear that forced to sit as much out of this the moderators should be a student

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.420
and have to hide from the law school the mother in laws

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:57.870
he wanted it student to moderate this afternoon's meeting is no discussion taking place on the stage countless hours as a record of mine i have his teacher

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:08.400
we had read and we got along very well and i think he i think he got a b plus pages one of which has one of the highest

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.600
grades i've ever given

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:21.420
i have no doubts about a commercial law when the dollar's subjects ever taught and if we could get along in that we

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.650
can go on a moderating and we will share these duties will be in constant consultation and we were

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.130
so students live in

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.900
central falls thing we will neither and he will point to find even more than it and

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.830

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:12.910

on president suddenly we started as our

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.330
first i wished to

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.790
a statement attributed to me

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.990
and various newspapers

00:07:52.850 --> 00:08:02.890
i am enchanted to me in various newspapers an hour and none of these newspapers or patients seem to agree among themselves this

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:12.940
has to do with his speech which i gave in evansville indiana now we won't give you won't think that i'm i'm

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:24.600
indulging our tell you what happened briefly and then tell you what i actually said and this connection i

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.740
went to evansville indiana to address an alumni group

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:42.030
but i foresee in the year two thousand when i arrived was just bare with me and an end even

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.540
his me when i'm finished

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.780
it's me now from i wrote

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.320
when i arrived i found that there was apprehension

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:10.770
and among significant number of people attending that meeting about what was going on and women question usually gets

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.290
put to me what the hell is going on

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.190
amazon dress myself

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:29.080
that's what the hell was going on and winning them on i'm summarizing here i had a been peaceful

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.550
bee and then the result

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.280
not only

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.600
young people

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:51.430
are considered to be on the left if there is such a thing but young people that across the spectrum of political opinion and

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.800
the thing

00:09:53.550 --> 00:10:03.700
was born and they were making a mall and peaceful protests to indicate they're concerned and in many

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.790
cases their disdain for what was happening in vietnam

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:20.570
until then that and that they had every reason to be proud of the students and the entire

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.660
academic community of indiana university this was

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.110
it

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.070
and there was a question and answer period

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:45.740
of falling water that also add that i stated that it was the policy agreed upon by the administration

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.920
that the university would remain open for those students who wish to attend

00:10:53.550 --> 00:11:04.140
that those students who did not wish to attend and who felt some moral obligation to go out and do something else we have demonstrated

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:15.950
all back to their hometowns and talked to the elected representative so that friends and neighbors song that we're free to do so hare

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.660
and the third

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:29.000
and there was this was on my worst massacre the questions that elicit the unfortunate and conflicting

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.910
quotations was the question

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.650
would you under any circumstances close the universe

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:51.050
and my answer to that was not that bad after i can remember all added huge bloody mayhem that the destruction

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:56.770
except for her but that i would certainly clothes

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.600
on my own initiative

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:11.670
if i fell that alliance of students five voting for citizens were in danger by any

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:20.430
activity or is known for it how all possibilities of grave damage to property

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.720
now that

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.420
is what i say wow i get that

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:39.440
i was reported in on paper how i'll remember that there were conflicting reports about what i said but that is in fact not repaid him because i don't remember

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:49.720
that they pervade of statement but that is what i say now let me get on to the second part of my statement as i know that you will have a lot of questions

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.420
that you wish to raise global myself a chance for carter

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.490
i feel that my obligation as the responsibility

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:08.960
is to provide an educational opportunity act in the classroom for those students who wish such an opportunity

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:20.750
that i do not feel that therefore that i can hold the university students to attend classes

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:32.990
and there are many thousands have paid their fees and have every right to expect that what they paid for them they will get its

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:43.060
their bag and what they want to do it's what the institution was originally set up to do and that's my obligation on the other hand the

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:53.910
pain

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:03.580
i do not feel that those troops move out of reasons of conscience

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:15.120
wish to go out and do something else or watching it is is not an affair with the rights of others to do their thing should in any way

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.790
be interfered with and so long as

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:31.950
they do not interfere with the rights of others to do their thing i feel is there as much the obligation of the university to protect those

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:47.020
who are doing something out as it is to protect those who attend class the peak

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.160
yes

00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:04.670
i'll try to keep it you know maybe i'll try to keep my comments relatively brief because it relates to a question of attitude

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:15.860
relating to the deal initially the student government demands which are made of the president sometime back on may one and then taught by referendum

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:21.550
run by the students on this item which also went to family members

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.120
that was set of demands and i won't speak to them very briefly first a man presented was that the university repudiate president nixon's plans for southeast asia

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.030
the early immediately go on

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.310
a pipe

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.750
i

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:07.920
listened to be as jonathan for the win and then there's you

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.370
it's obvious what you're sentiment is

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:23.410
now these demands were presented to the president of the university and when to speak first is if i remember a lot is the chancellor the president of that university

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.130
made a statement and we have public university

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:39.740
there's a kind of repudiation i would've moved the century but i wouldn't move different than simple reason he's appointed as president to preside over the educational

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:52.560
policy and direction of this institution not to make statements for those others on the faculty or among the students with relation to foreign policy i as

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:07.020
i had been mostly all that view of the bible that is well the bible the as a corporate body concerned with scholarship and learned its options that it

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:17.090
has a lot of it has a large number of alternatives open for protest or demonstration that all kinds of matters

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.610
which relate to political activities but not as a corporate body

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:31.860
number to withstand the campus complicity in southeast asia and opened the box of the iou foundation to supply information on government contracts

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.890
the books of the icu patients on government contracts have been a win for years

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:58.900
it is very simple to get access to the records on government contracts of this university one they're published less which come out periodically identifying

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:09.390
the contract secondly it is possible to examine the contract in the office of the matter the only thing that is withheld on the state of the contract

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:21.020
sections of the budget which relate to the individual stories of investigators this has been the case here for years and year after year and we have every week the same message

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.060
the books on government contracts are open

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:35.970
number three with permission of the financial commitment to the bobby seale defense fund for the pay

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:48.000
individuals spike lee and others can make contributions to this defense fund it is illegal to take general fund money and make contributions of this pie i

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.720
personally don't want to go to michigan city right now

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:07.170
for it now with ringing increasing the percentage of black students in the university in accordance with the percentage of the black people in the state

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:15.080
of indiana it's bleak

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.550
but you

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.520
the point of the matter is that we have been working on increasing

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:41.330
vice chancellor minutes of lanai are now the referral plan to try to further increase the number of black students i think there is a mythology here

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:52.500
that you want to say well that's you know what i said well if you want to take people and educative and you want to increase numbers we know that we

00:19:52.500 --> 00:20:02.670
have a smaller proportion of the number of black students now than we had in the nineteen fifties our intention is to do something about it and we've been meeting with the black school leaders and

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:11.800
let's let him finish your week as we we have met with the box too leaders on it and we're working constructively it

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:24.450
the aisle are buying it ended on male on the referendum was to close the university student gao with nine thousand plus the seven thousand plus yes i

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.280
was three quarters

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.810
of the letters why should the rights of those

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.270
who wish to go on to be turned off by the fact that the majority wrote

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:50.140
it's b

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.570
why weeds now

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:07.010
president sudden has opened the floor of our concern that those who really wished to withdraw from a crisis and do other things of

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:17.200
a construct teenager in relation to making their political position to know but we are concerned a protect their rights i'm quite willing to say that i

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:27.290
will i find the faculty council resolution passed yesterday urging the faculty to my particular attention of the us

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:38.490
and to take steps when they can be a provider but academic penalties are not felt by the students there is a myth in

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:46.930
this system which i find startling but administrators an issue orders to faculty about this they can't and they never have been able to

00:21:54.680 --> 00:22:05.290
there are four people might speak i'd like to do one other thing i liked i'd like to read you the names of those people who were arrested

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:15.720
in and tell you that if any of you know anything if your witness if you were there you know those people you saw something ago the student government office and write

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:26.180
down on a piece paper we are where we can get in touch with you what you're doing what he read their names anything you can remember wandering the names out like to invite president such as occurred

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:26.960
prior to

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.730
those people arrested

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.830
area

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:55.940
because of uncertainty and just a quarter of refuse that goes to those people arrested were william curly old job susan young gregory hess steve emory roger

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:02.710
know and mike jones in john paul's our hope we can all get more moral and has supported

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.450
our next speaker as vice presidents and body my cane but

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.110
i

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:31.270
go giving a squirt of immigration addition to having me

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.040
i wanna talk first about president certain statement

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:49.730
from our listeners and figures is true of the tone of the state was a little different than what was read yesterday own bias

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:59.960
on some things that he did leave out that i think people should know armed and we have contacted the initial press and they have told us that it

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.740
can deny it all he wants but its eloquence his

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.870
arm this is this is from the evansville press reporter

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:17.610
woods testified for these notes that she took his airport here he drove the alumni that it will remain open unless

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:29.630
really violent causing bodily harm a possible death and grievous property damage is forces me to close it but it will be bloody mayhem before i will close and

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:39.830
if i close that i will close it couldn't wrap this is something that the year salaries was season things will come to a standstill and it will stay closed on good

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:49.930
and ready to open it i was an appointed president university to deny anybody right to education no matter how reasonable our show to strike request as you saw

00:24:50.470 --> 00:25:00.770
i will not permit no it's not it's not always to be still upset about the statement that we

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:14.600
love said that the recently first person pronouns your own it have

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:26.260
but i think so many other things they'll mention here during his talk i will instruct of history and soccer you know calm under a headline it a president

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.730
determined keep a school open

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.360
palm

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:42.460
all the couples through city i used to government and certainly doesn't like he said the leader so far their students to obey rules and avoid violence i can't believe

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:52.480
it it may not last but it hasn't so up until now he said yeah it stays illegal like resisted government was leader calls itself a self styled like never

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:52.980
go to

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.690
it goes on to talk about how aug israel lot right off campus

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:15.030
and then there's another section it's very useful and you the people arrested today while he believes about this was also an adult cell phone picture banners to an injured

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:25.060
with the reporters own who is that there are about fifty students it it a campus dedicated to violent destructive acts who may be able to

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:35.530
raise two hundred to four hundred more for additional support the rest of fine young men and women were concerned about the war and other problems now are white out that revenues

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:45.630
fifty students are dedicated to violent destructive acts but they're not uniform but they do not carry four foreclosed baptist up in riot gear that that they do not

00:26:52.390 --> 00:27:02.440
they do not have to have tracked boys learned the town as was the last week of what's the police and the violence does this campus as wordsworth come

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.750
from those police

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:20.830
no serious had thought that some of the some of the other times didst lead lead if it stays open will break the national strike sense that there's no way

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:27.340
of telling who it out of time students likely clinton is a small town and cannot accommodate many out of town people he said

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.850
no no the final episodes

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:54.060
that into meetings at that i've had with the president and and the eyes as you're don't say against a thought

00:27:55.030 --> 00:28:01.970
that he would never not make a statement on foreign policy and at this time not even as an individual

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:14.650
because you know you know you know that his name could not be associated on the fact that he was president of indiana university and he made a statement to keep an eye out

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.260
twice an and he's been making it repeatedly

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.220
brought this is what

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.490
recorded two years ago

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:38.200
students have asked him to denounce the move into cambodia where certain who lived in thailand for three years as a special advisor to the government said

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:48.570
quote i don't even have the facts yet i'm a professional in this field and i cannot make a decision without the facts and quotes and then and then the final statement of

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:59.070
all the article which is not a direct quote which i learned of the record he said however that he personally favors to move himself army

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:09.320
would not make such a statement cia president beset the palace and they would never make such a statement so that it is not a question here of a political university oversees

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:16.340
politics in beijing university is a question of his son's politics first bob dixson people university

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:26.620
the panel

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:36.710
is needed dog induced a gimmicky but i released yesterday disney bought is responsibility of many other concerns did and i was

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:46.980
i was home preparing for class and i find out that dolphins might be arrested call i'm going to say that i was i was brought

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:57.690
those duties to east analyst thought of factly taking a stand out there have these bug time receiver city stan the pay

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.370
to play

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:12.900
all agreed that presence of infinite opportunities before mr parker makes as we live at

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.140
i didn't say a manmade known

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.700
i made no comment

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.600
on the iran as a campaign in cambodia you

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.580
were going to get to question their second

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:44.480
one more speaker man whose conduct is it has been exemplary in the ass we think

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:54.780
there's an interest in body it's been

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.250
the point

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.400
is big

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.070
i guess he's right

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:29.360
that has a meticulous and he is i think i might've said you know the city doesn't there's nothing now many of you have things to say the closer

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:39.510
you know what needs to be said in a very important also i like to speak first to our one man's man on bobby seale but we never

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:49.730
say that money would be taken on the gender fun you know to implement this we said that need to be made to raise money now people in an hour

00:31:50.410 --> 00:32:00.430
no matter how beautiful they may be an idea that the power they can relate to women about recent defense work now summers why we we understood this clearly from the star we had and

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:10.590
i have the means to raise money matters of the statement that mike and i made yesterday and i said you know that's a good mike and i have

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:20.830
a policeman in the muslim lunar ryan hall when i was speaking in terms of was that i think in a citizen of germans and mike and i would have to do all these jobs on campus that

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:31.130
officers might as well be in the president's office in rioting hundred am house aide again if those offices were up for election

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.750
mike and i would run for those two

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.610
the purpose of people being here today

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.380
is to once

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:53.830
ran what was on their mind directly to those people who should have some answers and one has to understand this everyone has to understand that you do have a right to

00:32:53.830 --> 00:33:04.000
speak out and not want to deny it is right in at the rights of those who want to attend classes are to be protected rights of those words speak out

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.490
must be protected

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.960
so i think it was mortar

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.300
ryan

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.320
all part of the people

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:37.110
you're listening to live coverage of the ministrations ten seconds for station identification

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:49.560
will will get questions from or a former quasar today of an oblique the carrion that people were no questions being accepted or

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:56.120
you can't get your microphone and her shop <unk> here here we can repeat your question

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.360
as

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:09.760
chants

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:24.010
and then suddenly this was out to be a question and answer session for president suddenly and chancellor are so that we can keep you know everybody here we are you know they

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.460
were done in the middle of the

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:31.740
year

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.070
people die

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:57.190
rhetoric about respecting people's rights i wondering seriously what action has to be taken by the student government because obviously they used it to stop be able from poisoning

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:04.890
people which is not a battery and just an amazing people pushing for extra people and closing doors of this as a violation of rights

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:10.080
ms ba

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.960
power

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:25.810
mike yet this was like day goes out lots of people in a restaurant on strike was i was not

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:49.140
i would say that i was reading on friday and though i was the most uninsured run an assault around this is the news we saw all those

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.650
as much as the scabs were bought by scheduled july

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.280
i think that you know

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.210
can we give the microphone and whether i'm sure she wants more

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:20.260
demanding that he'd ministration chances are demanding that the administration i'd like that

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.160
the pope

00:36:52.090 --> 00:37:02.240
as we clearly set the guidelines the picket lines in to find out because you have individual strains on every picket we made it clear made it clear they

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:12.320
would not be defined by a circus now we call for particular people is that of a blue stocking up close those lines it is their own choice as lawyers say

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:20.830
the poem

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.310
chancellor cantor was

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:31.430
a diamond all agree with you and i hope at

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:40.140
least know that the truth of the matter as i do not see how in the name of acts against repression

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.700
you repressed people that changed

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.710
at

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.230
all

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.180
can somebody personally

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.240
thank you

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:22.470
no this is wrong you want to rephrase your question

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.230
is

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.650
the question has been answered

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:45.170
i follow him

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:51.970
we can

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:12.780
it's b

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.990
just so you think i'm doubling the issue

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:28.520
is at the last council meeting this that this policy is decided damage by campus and we have said

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:34.540
the last opponent that was being the bloomington faculty council

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:40.760
election and made a recommendation to the faculty at last

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.920
an hour now i do not oppose this recommendation

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.730
and as a matter of fact it's quite in accordance

00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:05.360
with academic tradition as i have known now tesla car or give you details if you blew it you

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:15.860
got it that was passed was a resolution which essentially urged that faculty they serious attention to finding

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:26.280
means by which students with knots i've been delighted to make penalties for participation in political protests or going back home and saw what the top

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:36.700
people the options on this are not spelled out in the faculty council resolution because the various divisions of the burlington campus at

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:47.350
different kinds of new patents on parts of the us that part of arts and sciences policy committee as i understand it already made some suggestions and

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:57.350
acting at this the law school faculty was prepared to meet on this today i think the business school faculty is about to meet in their various alternatives

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:07.440
but i think you make a different things developed in different places obviously the incomplete is one with the deferred examination that might be a possibility it's easy to do for an instructor

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.330
they are relationships maybe

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:15.030
there are various options

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:26.830
that it is up to the individual faculty member to accept the recommendations which come to it because riding actresses around we're always stayed with the individual faculty

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:36.840
member and chuck turner was like right i have served at least three questions about bass and the first one has to do

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:50.790
with non violent spring for a great deal about nine months on this campus and i'd like to know who is responsible for calling police on this campus it's b

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:57.070
we have had for mayor booker that someone in the administration but please

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.130
call the police on this campus

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.730
i am ultimately responsible

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.210
because i'm president in the end

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:23.210
can we let me i'm saying to me oh because great sentiment on campus that lets responsibility

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:33.450
for what was true was that beleaguered a hat into the president released it's well known that the presence of uniform officers tend to incite situations

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.420
like that your joints that

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.980
four justices view of your manager

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:58.910
i don't want to give you people are going about their appointed tests and do not allow them

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:09.010
to do this and after i patiently waited for several hours and don't think this

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.630
entire genome

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:14.600
and you are

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:28.140
those were requested to vacate the doorways and we're an untold informed that they could open

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:30.360
it

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.160
to protect the lions were probably

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.960
yours and mine

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:56.400
my second question has to do with all otc more than a year ago the arts and science there was a committee of the division wasn't sciences which was composed of five pistons as

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:04.770
i understand which turned report in which favored the position that no they should be given for otc work at that time

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:17.410
mr university council committee was appointed as i understand at that time where you're going out and looking at our university got committee was appointed

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:24.910
and i have read that that committee has been in a report you find that you have access to the fines the committee

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.110
i'm a

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:39.070
bad report on the faculty council for instance immigration recommendations like deo recommendation was a i don't remember the details

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:50.110
but what you wanna know i didn't read them and the abolition of obviously you're not an answer is they did not what happened

00:44:50.110 --> 00:45:00.450
at one point because the arts and science reporter ago did not say no pettitte dc one even

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:10.640
has to make a recommendation to the faculty of the college of arts and sciences that was going on at sea should not be out within that portion

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:20.950
of the students total program that must be taken within the college of arts and sciences at best placed it in the same category as some of the other courses and professional

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.860
schools it can be taken within the

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:32.020
system we did not propose any immediate and private

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.960
about obesity

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:44.230
which were to be phased over a character that was set to end our university committee because

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:58.450
within the college but do all other students within that those divisions one last quick question are really smart and i don't know if all the books

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.330
open to public an inkling sources and uses of funds

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:05.680
and if not one of

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.870
us and says there is a

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:28.290
there's a public accounting of all university use of funds made to the state of indiana and

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.040
those documents

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:50.800
the foundation is going bio from outside the institution and the report of an honor is available in

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.200
the foundational is a crook

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.400
it has a visitor's visa

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:10.930
these are not ordinary times has not been an ordinary week and i don't think an ordinary responses from the administration nor appropriate

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.690
oh

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.950
i hope

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:30.470
i i think that the situation which indiana university finds itself in today the man's an extraordinary is cry

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:41.910
i may turn some of you off when i was a very clearly that i do not support those picket lines but if those lines were not close this morning we would not

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:53.470
be here today ta it's been

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:02.270
the pacific

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:22.480
now i don't know how many are at the daily spin this morning but i had a long essay and which was which was titled at the top i don't shut down the university if any of you any

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:30.250
of you read further than the title you would say that the important part of that recommendation of that essay was the recommendation not the title

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:41.950
my recommendation was basically the yale plan which i'll explain in just a second it was given to chester crocker forceful copy yesterday and the dean rt

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:52.270
rybak up yesterday and all of you read the speech this morning at an opportunity to see it i do not believe because of my deep ingrained civil libertarian principles

00:48:52.270 --> 00:49:03.200
that we live in the south for many years i do not believe an unbridled majority rule i do believe in preservation rights of the minority and

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:16.120
therefore i don't think the universities should be closed down for everyone the pope

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:27.030
it should continue in existence business as usual for those who wanted that way of hope when leavening but just

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:35.630
saying as the administration has made a mess and so for that the recovery will attempt to protect the rights of those who don't agree is not going up

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:52.360
i understand completely that the inability to receive restoration cannot order the faculty to do anything and i wouldn't have it any other way that i think they can clearly

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:58.780
make their feelings known that they agree with the recommendations to each individual school

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:10.480
to each individual school to handle any way they see fit to allow those of us a lot about the community one in washington who won't speak right lobby

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:21.080
in our own way or to do more constructive things during the next three weeks and take exams to do so and it should be a clear recommendation from

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:30.060
all the president and the chancellor that they're that classes will be waived exams will be waived and credit will be given automatically

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:44.620
it's by

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:53.280
the pain

00:50:55.060 --> 00:51:05.370
i did not believe in the productivity of interfering with the rights of those who sometimes for very sound pragmatic reasons are here at great personal expands into

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:15.390
themselves or to others i think they should be able to continue to go to class and continue to take exams and but i think that the university has an obligation

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:26.870
taken within the broadest possible context of what's been going on the country in the last ten days to see this step as an extraordinary step perhaps for this state

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:32.600
and this administration but as a very minor step taken when we consider the alternative

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:44.150
and i think we have an obligation to say yes well i would not ordinarily do so these are extraordinary times and i recommend to be in any other school leaders that they do

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.430
that they do exactly this

00:51:49.710 --> 00:52:08.400
it's been

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:21.670
i have the highest regard for this man from oregon with him and he spent two years in the air force resigns commission last year because it was ethically unjustifiable

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:30.820
and is president of the student out of the lot and he's a memory of me of the voters he's

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.760
got a chance for carter to mr boyle

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:42.040
well in my judgment

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:56.840
that i personally favored the recommendation made by the faculty council yesterday which went straight in the direction which has indicated i think whoa this was part of i'm sorry

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.280
the students were as

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:21.190
i was maintaining his department and tom ford taurus and shelley taylor and evan bauman i just came from the gao the

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:25.130
eight people were arrested on paper

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:29.520
they have been arraigned

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:41.360
fifty dollars apartment released on fifty dollars bail piece for dollars the bail money was raised by the

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:41.980
faculty

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.630
ms ba

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:55.970
ph

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:08.980
but there's one very important point about this and that's only because of a crowded conditions that time for us isn't talking to the written or march down here tom

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:17.010
is very concerned that represents the eighth june support from now on and thomas very much concerned that you all know

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.190
georgia made a particular effort

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.790
well

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:38.810
it could have been five hundred dollars apiece was the idea that there is going to be some precipitation to

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:49.780
this from our car that in other words the implication was quite clear that if they was going to be boston tonight it's

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.040
not going to be fifty dollars it's going to fall upon the peace

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:56.050
that

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:08.370
and i can say is i don't think we can raise five hundred thousand piece for numbers so i hope you'll

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.110
keep this in mind

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:22.670
we've got the money that stage and we would collect four hundred and thirty six thousand a decent ha

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:35.350
says those rows of the bailout i think it would be beneficial for us to put this into a permanent fun because of this that i'd given my mind it is going to be used again mr

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:45.620
mike milano announcement about the teach in the night seven pm right here in an auditorium and amazed because of the law professor stan ms

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:25.930
guys love the speed of

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.570
the peak

00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:00.750
there's been leaked

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.130
fbi

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.460
is bleak

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.590
please

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.110
please please please please

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:50.590
the fbi we just know that at least the issue of the rights of gaza want to go to class of and raised by several speakers

00:58:50.590 --> 00:59:00.420
have been responded to i don't think that particular statement will these more comments will not recognize other question gentlemen like they're

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.550
willing

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:23.700
to pay

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:35.880
people feel at

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.800
because i know they feel

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:42.000
it is the answer

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.020
because i know they feel anything

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:55.780
that if your listeners to be do i respect people's feelings and thereby

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.780
the point

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:25.740
is this oh bobby keeps coming back about the vote and what the referendum and i still don't think the question was really answered a moment ago when he

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:35.920
said there would be recommendations about students who had voted two percent voted to strike he's severely recommendations made

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:46.300
and the same time was a statement by the law professors at these are extraordinary times in view of the fact that they are and you can guarantee people's rights

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:53.870
to go to class why cannot guarantee the rights of those people who wished to decide fb

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.620
to pay

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.020
now this is really alarming

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:21.720
mario says he's willing to talk to but on friday after this as directly as i can answer because i was their accounts of discussion it was not because it's

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.480
a bloomington faculty council and i'm presiding he's not a member

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:39.000
i may i answer that question i think basically what i'm driving across the board is the administration is not authorized to make these decisions

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.260
but so what happened was the council recommended this kind of thing to get the faculty as a whole what is happening is that in division

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:59.330
after division of cause i get reports they are taking about as i said i think the arts arts and sciences college already has as private deal

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:09.510
with this fluid selected policy committee and the law school is meeting i know the business goes by enemy but i can't reach an

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:20.900
and tell them what they must do i can do what i say and express a sentiment of sympathy for the position but i

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:26.520
think he's great but i'd like to also has a connection with that is this a democratic institution

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.730
and if it is so how close to it

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:44.920
interest or institution and do you reconcile robert eggers with democratic ideals and principles or are they separate

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:55.030
there was a violent recommend referendum they can hear a majority of the students know that that's that's democratic i always thought was

01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:59.120
it

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:12.410
and this is a very difficult and profound question that's raised democracy is not so simple that it's

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:23.290
the mentions are self evident the question about a majority vote is a question of what belongs on the agenda you want by majority vote to strip the people their constitutional

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:33.800
rights the whole point of a democracy is it has limits the whole point of a democracy's our constitutional protections for certain minorities i as a host educated

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:44.330
people as people are attempting to understand our society we must begin to understand what you mean by democracy in a more complicated way and all questions unresolved

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:58.080
so there are issues as to what items can be put on the agenda the answers along the lines of every question is being away

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:08.320
are trying to walk a path we are trying to develop programs that to protect the rights of the students who are the center of the rights of the students who are feeling cable taking

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:18.420
exams i just came from a law school meeting where we have special constraints on how much we can relieve our students but we are struggling with this problem i know that i'd societies

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:28.670
we can at least agree but we cannot take action when the campus is a seriously split in the student go miami a majority vote principle

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:39.340
we can adjust matters in terms of grades and credits has been suggested that would do just as the ball that's the point of this meeting we have made an

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:49.610
out of an impact on how many votes comedy the students feel strongly that this university cannot merely continue we have shown we have done things and we can

01:04:49.610 --> 01:05:00.170
do it without creating better interests in basel perhaps know we'll add on these issues at their their rights to be compromised

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:10.260
by the majority was the bread of heaven actually like as you know as a moderator you know why you're on an artist

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:20.370
with a minor reasons that you point out the arrest was the eleven are not accounted for half and then i have one more question yes my soul isn't

01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:30.720
your rights are as innocent is asking for the police to go who was the person they got the police who was this person a second about

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:40.240
why we said that the honesty without various members of this a police force behind his eye test how

forty percent of the people in other states the president made clear at

01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:57.840
right now you're responsible not just nine thousand people and a pistol not to say we want something done and it's a lot of people it appears that also they say you know oh look at that

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.430
compliment i get this question right now

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.660
i mean the figures the right a

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:14.110
way

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.020
this is from a few people accuse the back

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:33.640

01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.540
do that

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:52.020
at

01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:03.520
at at he's been

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.550
in the past

01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:33.470
moore the president of his universe you're not you're a person and this thing about the night that doesn't enable need to feel inside that is

01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:34.210
a lot of ocean

01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:48.100
this is when you recognize people as people would get the chance to respond to major point you you know you've made your path at

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:58.790
life as a human being is this and again when i'm on one again and

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:14.060
i'll tell you exactly my individual history of feeling toward the war

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:26.510
in nineteen fifty eight when i returned from thailand i was greatly concerned with what i had seen as an

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:37.040
an almost unconscious policy commitment to military buildup in southeast asia that was going to lead to major ground war i

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:47.540
made those statements in public an implant and i made those that observation to as many people as

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.310
i could contact as an assistant professor without tenure at this institution

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.360
however

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:01.090
that no adequate explanation

01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:13.470
explaining to the american people at that this is in the offing and being as precise purposes whatever may nor

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.490
has it been made in my judgment

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.980
now that is not to say i don't know going to finish my father

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.170
please

01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:36.780
why that's about the size of eight years

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.240
now

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:50.510
and i admire the o's in nineteen seventy had not changed one of but one of the things i have on

01:21:52.550 --> 01:22:04.410
one other things that bugs may be on an online feel as if there is an assumption on the part of a great many people in this country than

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:15.040
asia and africa and the near east is a matter of no welcomes they consummate concern themselves

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.210
primarily with european policy

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:29.570
it is a mandate is an edible in my judgment that if we do not build meaningful and peaceful relations between

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:39.640
the peoples of asia and ever go oh i thought that's funny bill peaceful relations nobody's going asians with a stable

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:45.490
that we will eventually be destroyed my own problems is

01:22:49.370 --> 01:22:49.990
reagan is it

01:22:55.950 --> 01:23:00.450
ladies and gentlemen i gradually started i said we would run for an hour

01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:11.070
just a minute we've already run for an hour and twenty minutes we'll run till five thirty and i want to recognize the balcony the german right oversight

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.110
and i'm sorry i couldn't see you before yes

01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:54.680
if islam me if it either put the question why clemson allows people going two weeks before the campaign to help the campaign

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.870
for their congressman is that not right

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.350
can i had i would have no objection that was it was all over

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:18.660
in a given event the recommended end and a family who control the curriculum and the courses then i wouldn't know shake your head because that's the essence of the university

01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:30.010
but i would have no objections or an unknown oh that's that's my head as a member of the faculty council i think there's a

01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:40.120
very good chance that this issue i've discussed this issue with other people i think there is a great deal of support this is not this is more important than the immediate issue

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:50.680
if we're going to end franchise the students ever going to reduce the voting age eighty if we're going to recognize that they're away from their communities and cannot legitimately

01:24:50.680 --> 01:25:03.640
participate this is the best thing that's come along in education since going to harvest the crops the pope

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:16.010
like to tell you that yesterday at the faculty action committee i made a proposal which may help to answer the question that was raised was impressed me on the presence of the arm

01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:26.370
the proposal i made was to suggest to the political science department that they want for a chorus which

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:36.740
would make it possible for students say to come hear the details have to be worked out to come here for two was three weeks for very intensive session at the beginning of the term to

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:47.000
study the campaigning practices at cetera et cetera and for the students to be able to go out into the field for six weeks until election

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:57.020
day of practical experience campaigning in their home communities or here in monroe county work for a candidate their choice and to

01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:01.930
get political science credit for this and then to continue their education the second half of the term

01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:09.340
we're going to have a response to a question to your wife

01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:15.190
i don't have any objection to the whole planet

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:37.600
it used to be that vague political science department the known as government made arrangements of the kind that are being proposed here

01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:49.250
i can remember in the campaigns of nineteen fifty two and nineteen fifty six that was available i do on that one little thing about that stunned because i think

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:59.260
that our body is no getting excited and pleased with them i think what manson is done is to take two ok reading weeks and move them up in france and

01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:09.280
is not changing its price contact hours the opera will be before the next question we past the motorcycle helmets are people to ride

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.930
around the city without a mocha boston

01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:53.200
the penguins

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.130
the answer is they can

01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.910
from mining that they don't in a veil of those tunes are one of the

01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:07.950
pa i'm a question of the john wayne

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:25.010
as i said maybe ten years we're going to have somebody animates the money because these days ago there was maybe to make some money in an opening when his sub is now

01:28:25.410 --> 01:28:35.920
about jobs than right i want to say and if you could come down there sit in here in a second he says reading books about ten eleven fourteen forty eight and the band in nineteen seventy

01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:38.420
and it isn't about it and i didn't listen to

01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:45.440
me

01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:49.740
and i recognize there is the gentleman in the wings

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:56.470
it

01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:12.740
was june for construction of his university of the people in the audience have been directing moral questions to the speakers have been getting practical rational

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:23.140
legal lipstick and government distinct type answers back man here as the most obvious question what are these people going to do

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:28.450
to help us the nine thousand of us that voted to strike and i like that answer to go

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:45.410
is anyone accused answer that i don't really want more wheat and say we will protect your identity same way will protect your right to strike we

01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:54.420
have said that we are sympathetic to the idea of trying to work out no academic family i think what we're doing is we're going over the same day

01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:04.910
do you can now professors are getting are great because they intimidate us in class

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.490
because they disagreed with the professor you know

01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:24.610
because i don't already there and i don't want violence but what i didn't know is how has the authority to say that the professors that won't let us take it past they all want it

01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:31.440
was a critic not a jewish area for what we believe in they just disagree with this

01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.760
we want to know

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.640
like

01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:48.970
really interesting though there's a new novel like it is nobody knows the

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.100
keys

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:05.400
professors i think that's because of it and then leaves you can begin to show proof of prejudice against you by instructors yes you can find mechanisms

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:16.530
usually usually you can start through departmental chairman or teens who are not teens identity and slays

01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:18.240
i will

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:29.590
say i have one more question people are standing up they're complaining they hadn't been recognized that yes

01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:40.550
the peak

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.040
i'm

01:31:57.010 --> 01:31:57.620
doing all

01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.310
right

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.350
only an academic officer

01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:32.850
did i visit generated find it mean they've got an academic vice president or chancellor

01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:41.330
nailed it

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:51.050
only i use a delusion is not authorized

01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:54.190
and some money authorized

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:04.660
yes

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:09.300
somebody's realize that i did it

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:23.390
a lady and they're in this thing whatever it is though someone downtown in the courtroom now being iranian court for

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:33.620

01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:43.830
and i was in the backseat speaking in that engagement was driving and we were stopped by a nest and thirsty least i have to say

01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:53.960
just to try and when alice goes well then answers to a question as to what was there they just ignored as attentive listeners to try to find

01:33:53.960 --> 01:34:00.850
anything that good is that the announcement of his rally tonight i want to know it and now they've arrested

01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:06.350

01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:09.080
make them wait

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:22.500
why why why the words inspired by those three policemen died obviously and you were with a campus police riot while i went well

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:22.910
it is that

01:34:32.130 --> 01:34:35.170
i know nothing about it i did not audition

01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:46.000

thank you

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.520
i hope that we have allowed a day

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.530
they may have a

01:35:09.610 --> 01:35:11.980
new

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:32.670
and so at this afternoon's programme rather shattering conclusion that might have been caught on stage and students

01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:42.680
are still attempting to speak to the crowd assembled this four thousand plus crowd was reportedly another few thousand outside the

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:53.110
beginning facilities were made available so that those of you a television report of this in other parts of the campus speaking
