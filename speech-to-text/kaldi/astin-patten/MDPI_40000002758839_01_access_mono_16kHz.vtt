00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.850
yeah

you know

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:24.370
the pope

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.700
like everybody of a white and the management thing we're probably a year pay

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.010
the honoree in the backyard ok

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.710
i'm going to put the light on here so i can be

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.590
that we all know we traditionally the blind student success

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:11.180
in terms of what was good news in college in terms of the time honored grade point average or if we wanted to a minimal kind of

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.380
bomb success having courses and finishing their degree program

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:30.810
and it won a look at a high level we've divided in terms of receiving honors the various kinds and then after college we

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:40.870
look at success in terms of the things that the entry to graduate school war or perhaps oh what kind of graduate school you're able to enter how we believe

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:50.980
in those or whether we get a job and especially work what kind of job indeed how much of haiti's

00:06:51.330 --> 00:07:01.870
wanting to have been used in many cases measures of fix that but in a sense these are all when one way or another traditional academic

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.340
ok

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:12.910
all their earnings for example it's like that's probably the quote won in a sense of the gpa

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:26.510
the post college or so these things are all connected activity all are measures of success now the promise of my caucus afternoon

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:36.720
is that while there's nothing inherently wrong or simple about these traditional measures arm there are simply not enough

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.870
and if we preserved in linking our conception of it and fix thats or limiting our competitive in fact that in the way

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:57.360
we're selling short not only our institutions and our students but also testify at the portsmouth winning writer explain why i

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.430
believe so

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:10.810
there's mounting evidence that the quality of civic life and civic engagement in the united states have been eroding in recent years or was the provinces

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:21.450
along when an iowa one of the waiver but when to this review imagine a few of these things shape the race relations growing economic disparity and inequities

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:32.300
excessive materialism the cane inner cities a deteriorating infrastructure are weakening public school system and you're responsible

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:42.420
mass media declining civic engagement and the increasing enough in the increasing effect excuse for decreasing effectiveness

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:52.460
of government all agencies and people remain just that live in a democracy of course citizen disengagement from politics and

00:08:52.460 --> 00:09:02.810
government ineffectiveness not only go hand in hand but also cripple our capacity to educate a new generation of leaders in government business

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.070
along medicine authority and other advanced professions

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:20.360
since our colleges and universities educate each new generation of leaders in these fields and train all the personnel who teach the entire population

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.990
of the pre collegiate level

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:32.300
we in the higher education community must bear some responsibility for the societal problems that the spurs so much

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:44.190
apparently are graduates are not successful and not in these other areas it began to solving social problems and

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:54.330
indeed they have become a part of the problem and considering that our higher education system is generally regarded as the finest one of the world we need

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.670
to ask ourselves where have we gone wrong

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:08.110
the more i reflect on the problems confronting higher education in larger society the more i became convinced that at the heart of these problems

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:20.000
in trying to effect positive social change is a question of beliefs and as those of you who heard the tuesday night well and

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.320
this is sort of my current preoccupation by this i mean not only our beliefs about what students success means but also our beliefs about the meaning and purpose

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:41.610
of a liberal education and are you are you of the role that higher education should play in the larger society to speak of success means

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:51.990
very little and makes little sense unless we also consider the issue of success and what an in other words our beliefs about hidden successor

00:10:51.990 --> 00:11:02.360
closely tied to our beliefs about the purpose of education and the role of higher education in the society the problem's not just for their beliefs

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:12.570
about these matters but also that the police remain largely on examined and on exposed while we discuss and debate the educational policies

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.970
and practices that emanate from

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:24.020
why we are educating our students has to do with the relationship between higher education and society

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:36.470
but different people hold very different views about this relationship and it's important that we expose and identify and recognize and honor these

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:46.880
different views an extreme view which would probably be in court by only a small number of our core academic the leader with the truth perhaps

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:57.020
robert maynard hutchins is that the university should remain waldock from the external world practical of errors so students can learn and studied and

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:07.140
faculty can pursue truth and the stir by worldly distractions and i would call it the ivory tower you'd what

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.060
we're all about

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:20.290
now the ivory tower concept might have a certain appeal appeal for some of my academic colleagues and i must admit i know you have a great deal of appeal it

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:30.480
could not and never will represent a viable conception i'll higher education and its role in modern american

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:40.880
society like it or not higher education is a creature of society it's sanctioned and supported by that society and has interned

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:51.240
whether that self serve that society in its mission statement since catalogs and other public pronouncements other words we're sort of on on the hope

00:12:51.310 --> 00:13:01.480
here in our rhetoric an alternative belief system which seems to dominate discussions of educational policy these days is what

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:09.260
i perhaps been charitably like to call the peg board view of what we're trying to do

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.480
one of the more views than six

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:24.280
of how prepared the student is for work the peg board you also is what drives what i like to call

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.260
the competitiveness argument solve with these appear together because they mirror wins

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:47.710
this is the dominant belief system not only are captives are captains of industry but also most politicians and policymakers not to mention many students teachers

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.520
and parents

00:13:50.900 --> 00:14:01.600
the idea here is that higher education must deliver more people with expertise in science technology and modern management techniques so that america's economy can remain competitive

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:12.200
with the economy the western europe and especially with emerging economies on the pacific rim my main problem with a peg board and compare and competitiveness abuse is

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:22.460
that they represent an extremely limited conception not only of the role of higher education but also of what the larger society at all about when we consider

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.110
the major problems plaguing our society

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:38.330
it's very difficult to imagine how the peg board you win the competitive you are going to contribute much of this simply to build job lock on

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:48.910
the labor market certainly is not going to do the trick when it comes to dealing with problems like hiv arctic the king inner cities two are racial problems

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.980
for the inequities in the distribution well and so forth

00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:04.840
now at close cousin of the big war you have what i like to call a private economic benefit you or the consumer you point about

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:14.960
what we're all about and the at that particular viewpoint argues that the purpose of higher education is too

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:25.480
enable people to read more apple uncomfortable lives and a lot of the politicians like the advocate dispute global populace you as they see it for the more education

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.190
you get the more money you can make and even the rat to live in terms of productivity

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.980
argument that you do with productivity

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:46.760
and even if we were to accept the other argument that private economic benefit provide the main coptic patient for our existence as educational institutions

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:57.480
this particular beliefs have been the extremely limited because it has little to say about how the society as a whole is served by such an approach you

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:07.880
know there were like maybe a laudable goal to contribute to the economic comfort and wellbeing of those citizens who were fortunate enough to enter and complete higher education

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:18.470
this viewpoint have little to say about what's going to happen to people and don't go to college or complete college north that doesn't say anything about how

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:28.930
if all the many other social economic problems that i've mentioned earlier we'll be addressed by such an approach an entirely different kind of belief system

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:38.970
is implied in the various public pronouncements that i've already alluded to that we make in our mission statements and catalogs in presidential

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:49.280
fate of the college reports and so forth in many ways these sometimes lofty statements come as close as anything that john gillies conception of the proper

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.410
role of education in society if we were to study the mission statement that in fact meet some of our brightest

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:07.300
the mission statement of a randomly selected group of american higher education patients we would sell them if ever find any mention of private economic

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:17.740
benefits international competitiveness or killings was in the labor market on the contrary when it comes to describing its educational mission

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:28.020
that the university will use such language as preparing students for responsible citizenship developing character developing future

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:38.580
leaders preparing students for society and so on in other words a brutal believe our own rhetoric those of us who were in the academy

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:48.830
see ourselves as serving it and promoting in strengthening our particular form of democratic self government we might prefer

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:54.470
that path the citizenship or the fort worth concept of our mission

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:06.480
walk like a belief system does not preclude individual economic benefits or killings watson the labor market or enhancing economic competitiveness

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:18.860
the central focus is on responsible for this initiative and sort of the citizenship you i would argue implies a much

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:28.960
broader conception of student success and the other view clearly the manner in which we approach this issue of student success

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:33.020
will depend heavily on which of the belief system that we embrace

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:44.560
success in life one thing if we see ourselves simply as helping young people will eat more comfortable with apple id laws but quite another thing if we see ourselves

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.010
of working together to strengthen our society and our democracy

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:59.040
given the current state of our democracy in our society i would argue that we have no choice but to embrace this view

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:11.050
the problem of course is that if you look at the typical american college or university curriculum and his co curriculum its teaching and personnel practices and the values

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:22.160
that government's administrative policies it's very typical fine much evidence about or commitment preparing students for responsible citizenship most

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.830
patients have simply not put their citizenship

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.340
into practice

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:41.900
like a growing interest in service and civic engagement within the academy and this is a very healthy development it seems to me there's a lot more we can do to really knew and revitalize

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:51.950
civic engagement and democracy in the us in the classroom for example we can start getting more attention for the development of those personal qualities

00:19:52.140 --> 00:20:02.190
which are crucial to say that life and effective democratic self government and by defining qualities such as self understanding you know that's kind of

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:13.000
the basis of all the great philosophical religious tradition where is that in the curriculum i have a hard time finding self understanding listening skills

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:24.370
leadership and to be honest the generosity the the ability to work collaboratively

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:35.970
most elite qualities example kayak what aereo would call emotional intelligence we can also begin to introduce the concept of civic

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:46.010
responsibility and citizenship in the faculty discussions the correct theory form such a shift in our correct our discussions would be easy to justify

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:56.960
given the fact that as i've said our catalog mission statement for all full of that kind of rhetoric and given some very promising current developments in the curriculum area

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:07.340
and i'm thinking here of the emphasis on multiculturalism in the environment as just two examples we can also build on these efforts by introducing general education content

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:18.200
that focuses more directly on issues of contemporary american civic light and democracy and well i mean by this the central role of information and

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:28.360
the mass media theory of them are things that you have a formal letter to the work or i don't think the mass media or exactly without problems in this

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:38.630
area the possible causes of declining civic engagement and declining trust in government the escalating role of money in politics the

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:49.080
growing corporate influence and soul that along with the bees and we could do much more to institutionalize service warning both in the general education curriculum

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:59.230
and in the major and i think we can all do this and those who complain that requiring service the militias that all i can say is

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:07.940
that we diminish english comp by requiring a week we require what we value

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:20.160
so we make a value statement when we require something with what i really suggesting here is that we can begin to broaden our conception of student success to include

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:27.620
anyone comment on the part of the institution to renewing civic life and civic engagement in american society

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:39.020
and we can manifest that commitment by embracing significant changes in our curriculum teaching practices reward system community relations and most

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.420
importantly in the values and beliefs that guide our policies and practices

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:54.950
i might endure that are narrow definition of student success is in many ways parallel to our narrow approach the defining finally success

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:06.600
and the research universities we pay lip service to the importance of teaching mentoring and universities service but the fact is that the faculty success

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:16.780
is defined nearly exclusively in many places in terms of research and scholarship by the fall important finally collins like a good

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:26.800
college which are so critical to creating a real academic community get little or no way in judging the professional footsteps of are calling

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:38.820
in mike patton lecture on tuesday evening i discussed are traditional beliefs about what makes our institutions excellent and forgive me for

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:48.910
repeating myself but they're a lot more people here and a veteran and so at least either refresh you were your memory in this report the gospel according to sandy so

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.580
i don't mind preaching at once more

00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:04.270
most of us the pirates once in terms of either of their the resources that we have and i've got a new charter you guys who are eager to see the quake

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.530
and now i'm getting quantitative about this

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:15.440
where we live wire rack with in terms of what we have and what others think of us this is

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:23.690
what i would call the egocentric approached the defining excellence and end up

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:36.390
and while and while there's nothing inherently wrong we have to have resources to function we have to have reputations to attract students and faculty when we concentrate

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:47.790
on these at the end at the ultimate definition of our excellence we again diminish an end and the value student

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:58.200
learning a lot and as i had argued tuesday night that that what we really need to move toward the concept of excellence that

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:07.570
based on how fact that we were able to educate our students but effectiveness and statistics that's being seen in much broader terms

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:19.430
my concern about the reputational and resources conception is that they fail to address directly our basic societal purposes with teaching public service not we don't need

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:29.490
these rare resource a reputation but paradoxically it can also cause for neglect our report commissioned the irony of that the government

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:38.070
become more focused on acquiring refer to an hour then in nurturing and developing the research now that for us

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:52.160
the roots love the radio are most intractable problems in academia i would argue can be found in this preoccupation with resource

00:25:52.210 --> 00:26:02.260
acquisition and reputational and handsome when you just quickly review these guys are familiar to all of those and yet we don't normally think about the midterms

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:08.360
of how vera price all our beliefs about what makes perfect

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:20.920
for example the valuing of research over teaching and the struggle between equity and excellence and the issue of individualism versus

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:31.150
community are all in one way or another connected to our beliefs about the importance of acquiring more resources and enhancing our reputation we

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:41.470
value research more than teaching because we believe that outstanding scientists and scholars will have more to our reputation and resources that we'll outstanding teachers

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:51.700
or mentors and when we define our excellence in terms of the test scores of the entering students a high five points and the thing you hear

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.570
is a resource

00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:04.930
that enhances our reputation we set our sense of excellence in direct conflict with our desire to promote educational opportunities for those groups or societies

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.760
that support for them at a competitive disadvantage

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:19.340
finally when we placed the highest value in the individuals finally accomplishments of our students and faculty we reinforced their competitive in individual individualistic tendencies

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:31.100
making it very difficult for them to develop those qualities that help promote a sense of community on the campus and again i mean good colleague ship collaboration

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:41.450
community service citizenship and social responsibility for these latter qualities of course are the same ones that are needed to make any democracy

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:51.460
work if we really mean it when we claim that education is our central mission and student learning should be up the heart of our conception

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:59.620
of excellence i like to call with the civic or our development you love

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.900
what our mission is all about

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:16.370
however even we accept this palpable you we strongly than to the question which talents and to what end

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:28.430
as i can for all the ways in which our traditional beliefs about excellence and student success interfere with our ability to improve and strengthen civic life

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:38.600
in american society no problem strikes me as being more important than the education of the so called run media law or under

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:48.730
prepared students now by examining this issue and some that we can begin to see how it might be possible for higher education institutions

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:58.150
not need to broaden our conception of student success but also to become more effective agents of positive social change

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:10.140
if we fail to develop more effective interventions for our so called romeo or developmental students will find it very difficult to make much headway

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:20.710
in resolving some of our most pressing social and economic problems and by this i mean unemployment crime welfare healthcare

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:31.140
racial tensions the mal distribution of wealth and citizen disengagement from the political process i say this first because under prepared

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:41.550
students are have historically been the ones most likely to drop out of at any level of education and second because a person's

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:52.240
with relatively low levels of educational attainment account for a disproportionate number of welfare recipients prison inmates poor people the unemployed

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.860
and people who don't work

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:06.140
beyond this the issue of race relations and affirmative action are intimately connected to the issue on the preparations since we've created a competitive hierarchical

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:16.230
system which dispenses privilege on the basis of measures that we come again with sex fascinated with the epa and the test scores that put our

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:20.980
two largest racial minority groups at a competitive disadvantage

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:32.320
if our educational system allocate its resources more equitably across these various groups by socioeconomic and race measures there'd be

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.480
little need for affirmative action

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:46.150
it goes without saying that the under prepared students have a kind of a pariah in american higher education and some of the reasons are obvious since most of us believe that our

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:51.680
exports depends on enrolling more and more of the very best prepared students

00:30:53.290 --> 00:31:01.580
to admit under prepared students would pose a real threat or a sense of excellence why would any sane institution want to do this

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:13.510
but here republicans conditions encounter a bit of a butt one of sinful law and many states requires the least some under prepared students be given an opportunity

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:24.020
to pursue postsecondary education happen this be done so we don't put our x once address the answer chorus is that we've created a higher public

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:34.360
systems where the least well prepared students are consigned to either a community colleges or a relatively non selective public colleges and

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:44.620
one selective institution find themselves forced to admit a key wonderful character hadn't for example to maintain competitiveness in division one aa works

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:53.090
and probably on the ferry nobody more under prepare them division one a revenue sports athletes

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:05.010
they like wives avoid having much contact with the student by hiring part time tutors and part time instructors from the outside to do the work

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:17.110
these tracking practices exert a subtle but powerful influence on the attitudes and beliefs of our students and indeed of the larger society

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:29.500
we're probably going to be influenced much more by what we do in our admissions process for example then by what we say about such things as the quality

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.280
of opportunity or multiculturalism for educational equity

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:47.250
by practicing selective admissions using these narrowly defined measures of student success we're sending important value messages we don't value

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:57.600
the education of the students with the war's horrors and we send this message not only to our own students but also to the remedial

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:08.400
students whom we reject for those who must teach them into the larger society no wonder peeking under prepared students is viewed as unglamorous

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.940
on important and many and the meaning

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:19.020
why don't while under prepared students make up so uncomfortable

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:31.380
isn't just that they're more difficulty which i believe they are and that their presence on campus threatens our sense of excellence or are there deeper reasons

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:42.660
while our belief about student success and the importance of resource acquisition and reputational amendment are fairly obvious we can see these upon a little

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.170
bit of reflection and

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:58.570
there are other believes that we harbor as academics and that had a tremendous effect on our practices that are largely unacknowledged much

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.530
less critically examined

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.000
and one of these policemen forgive me if those of you read my chronicle higher education

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:10.080
higher rate on the us

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.890
one of these police i like to characterize as the importance of being more

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:29.280
now this may sound weapon all what i think if you think about it for a while critically in terms of your of your experience in this institution or any other

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:38.670
perhaps if you will of what i mean there are many other terms like that humans are smart i think growing of creativity intelligence

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.590
but for the purposes of our discussion now even more important

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:55.500
my many years is far higher education as a loyal reporting a riff like that one convinces me that much of our fear of remedial students and much of our

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:05.820
unwilling earth again involved in educating them can be traced to our own credibility acceptance of this belief and for the fact that most of us are not even caught me aware

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:16.030
of the power and scope of its influence not that was clearly favor arthritis not only in admissions but in the world of financial aid and also

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:26.100
in the classroom ip right students and mortar institutions and take our classes then this reflect well on her own writers surely we must be

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.270
used more departments are so smart

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:42.860
mark and that reflects poorly on us this may help to explain why so many academics keep a very close ally on the average

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:53.180
test scores of me entering freshmen if arrested are getting smarter they were reassured about our own smartphones but if they're getting dumber our sense of our own smart

00:35:53.180 --> 00:36:01.470
this is rotten no wonder we hire others to teach remedial students are simply avoid them altogether electric than that

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:11.690
the real problem here is that we value being smart much more than we do developing markets

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.950
if our relentless are largely unconscious preoccupation with being smart

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:30.830
we forget that our institutions primary mission is to develop new actual capacities in other capacities of our students not merely to select and certified those

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:41.110
whose intellectual pounds or all what he wrought well developed by the time they come to us this preoccupation with being smart is also part of the reason why we continue to

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:51.120
use measures of student success the gpa and they're like that or that are geared for ranking and writing students rather than the

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.440
reflecting how much they're actually working

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:05.620
we although students who get a summer courses didn't put out any upper didn't learn much but they were very smart and very bright very clever when they came to us and they're able to get towards

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:15.780
iran i've already suggested that these assessment devices the chiquita standardized test imply a very narrow standard of smart

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:25.820
guns but they're also a little value of hearing helping students to learn or in helping us to evaluate the success of our pedagogical

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:36.490
efforts we we inflict the same a normative approach with having students on the lower schools such the politicians

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:46.980
and the public now evaluate the quality of these schools simply on the bases of which ones have the smartest students rather

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:56.310
than on the basis of which ones are the most effective educationally and i mean this defective even in terms of this narrow standard of smarts

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:06.030
this approach not only doesn't violence for the wonderful diversity of student talents by forcing them all into a single continuum

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:17.830
but it also it also have the effect of sending a message to the relatively low scoring student your dom you're

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:27.360
lazy you're not college material it's no wonder so many students drop out of the educational system before the average quality

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:43.430
a simplistic yardstick like yes it you're the a c t off as used by many of us as a principal indicator of the students

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:53.840
of the lawyers are our or markers but by doing this we implicitly diminish the great social and cultural importance of the citizens

00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:04.290
have talents that i mentioned such as empathy self understanding honestly responsibility leadership and the goatee work collaboratively i might add

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.840
here that this narrow approach the defining

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:17.120
in assessing talent or merritt has been turned against us with considerable success by the opponents of affirmative action

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:30.670
i think it'll be very difficult to challenge the traditional notions about student success and educational excellence unless we do it collectively well

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:40.810
american colleges universities can be justifiably proud of their diversity and their autonomy a collection of three thousand institutions simply doing

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:50.890
their individual things that not necessarily make for a coherent or effective system the problem is not that we're also wonderfully different and diverse

00:39:51.420 --> 00:40:01.800
but rather that the sum total of our individual and coordinated effort doesn't always add up to a meaningful hole when i really asking here

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:12.040
it's never been a protest in defining our excellence slowly in institutional terms or are we going to be willing to bite the bullet and

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.580
take a systems perspective

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.530
and explain what i mean by this

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:28.660
unless we can sit down together and collectively began to discuss our systems responsibilities for deciding

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:42.250
our effort to become excellent as individual institutions will continue to thwart our efforts to achieve real educational excellence as a system if

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:52.390
nothing else and then expanded into institutional conversation about the issues that i've been mentioning here at the systems model would make it clear that all of us

00:40:52.390 --> 00:41:02.710
in higher education not to mention the rest of the society have a heavy state and broadening our conception of students' success and in

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:12.910
redefining our concept of what makes us next one and in particular on the priority that we must assigned to the effect of education of the under

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.960
prepared students

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:26.140
at the state and systems and local levels we have to sit down together all types of institutions and begin a serious discussion of our mutual and build once about

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.980
remediation and under preparation

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:40.850
these institutional conversations could also cover a number of other related issues that cry out for collaborative effort ordination expansion of community service and service

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:51.920
warning program community needs local government problem with diversity and multiculturalism sharing resources admissions transfer credit and so forth but

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:57.450
the one that pride that most urgently for attention of the under prepared for remedial snowden

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:09.670
the necessity for us to move away from a purely competitive and individualistic mindset what's good for our institution and two about more of a collaborative work and

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:19.930
social approached the defining student success sent to the under preparation problem becomes clearer when we consider what might happen if one of us were trying to go

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:30.380
along as long as a different car to universities in the state continue to operate independently and persist in their traditional beliefs about excellence

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:40.590
and in the case of it was a lot of state for the region the big bend region any institution automatically puts its excellence that rove's

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:51.490
it that you like really besides to broaden its inception of success and to admit substantially greater numbers of unprepared students or to invest substantial

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:53.760
enormous resources in educating but

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:06.350
if we could be successful in stimulating the kinds of systems discussions of these issues that i'm envisioning hear the conversation would soon begin to focus on the various arguments

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:16.020
that we've traditionally used to defend selective admissions for example of tripoli and the fans is what i like to call the projections are gone

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:30.320
now too put this in a nutshell the protection argument said that we defend the use of these narrow conception since the talent and success

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:40.420
the gp in that score on the grounds of a perfect performance in college and in the day to protect but the projection is less

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:46.800
than ideal but they can predict undeniably the case now imagine

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:58.480
what would happen if our medical health care or to take the same approach that its admissions policy and i draw a parallel

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:08.500
here between medicine and health care and one and education than the other because we're all using in the old analog and the protection argument makes sense

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:18.510
in the case of a business that is trying to compete with other businesses and what the higher that's how it looks like that count for its own purposes the

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:28.730
six feet in competition with this model simply doesn't make sense for education and i think by illustrating this with a medical well what you can see what i mean that

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:39.000
under that kind of a system we would have a large number of popular web they're under on that that are poorly that the airport authorities

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.110
and that it will affect it

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:51.020
we would then have a smart group of instant of of our clinics and hospitals that would have gone

00:44:52.750 --> 00:45:03.120
barrett with all these barricades back and folklore which is minute our patients with the moderately severe illnesses and then we have a small group of

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:13.400
the week clinics and hospitals with the best paid and best trained staff and all about the most modern apartment which admitted only patients with common calls

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.020
and i would make a lot of plans for health care

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:31.940
as black

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:42.050
public interest what civic interest rates or by concentrating the least well prepared students in the institutions with the least resourced

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:54.160
how can such an arrangement be rational life in terms of the larger interests of the community in the safire the fact of the matter is that it came to

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.350
see why this is so we can again use the knowledge of medicine

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:07.080
and i think in the case of love of medicine we would create

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:19.420
pass a massive number of untreated or poorly treated people who would then cause us to

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:30.350
go broke if you will trying to rehabilitate them are they would be capable of working their families would write topical brooklyn to pay for their own treatment

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:40.690
on a private basis and so forth so it seems to me that in just the same way that not valuing the education of the other paris and by the way we structure of the nation

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:51.340
we're creating the same kind of problem or cell leader on now we took more of a systems approach for defining statistics after confronting the problem under

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:58.660
preparation it's important to keep in mind that our greatest untapped resource maybe the students themselves

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:10.020
there's probably no other group that's better suited to totally unprepared students then they're better prepared here such peer tutoring could be built

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:20.190
into the curriculum in a systematic fashion everyone would then more pedagogical resources would be invested in the

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:31.730
education of the under prepared and the better prepare students would have an opportunity to master course material in greater depth by teaching at the other as

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:37.970
i said a couple of meetings earlier today i don't think i get over teaching students who don't know what i know

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.960
maybe i don't know i

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:55.730
it's such a mentoring tutoring program were expanded to include a variety of service learning opportunities for example for students to work with unprepared students in the public schools the

00:47:55.730 --> 00:48:00.480
bonds between higher education and a local community would be great for and

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:14.550
the problem with that are plaguing our contemporary democracy are in many respects the same problems that the tokyo identified more than a century and a half ago

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:25.000
and that is the tension between individualism and community and it acted out at the institutional level fire individual competitiveness in quest for greater

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:35.080
excellence you wanna move up in the pecking order and it and push others down this tension is exacerbated by the mistaken belief that

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:45.180
we are independent all in separate from each other even our most recent research on stage from which i talked about tuesday night highlights the

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:53.340
importance of community the single most important source of influence on the individual student turns out to be a peer group

00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:05.640
in light of the reduced funding and other external pressures that we're experiencing today don't think really they're asked do we have the wherewithal to undertake

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.450
the kinds of new ventures i've been suggesting the second

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:20.390
in our haste the man the barricades to defend ourselves against external threats we're inclined to forget that the autonomy that we seek to protect may

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:30.460
be the most powerful tool that we have for reshaping our notions of student success and institutional exports more in the

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:38.920
direction of promoting democracy in citizenship there's nobody standing in our way of doing this except ourselves

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:50.200
the fact remains in the final weekend of forget that we still retain control over practically all of the say and that really matter who to admit

00:49:50.240 --> 00:50:00.770
and how to admit what horses and what work to require of our students what to teach how to teach it how we assess and evaluate our students

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:11.460
how we define their success how we structure our co worker programs how we hire reward and can hear our colleagues what policies

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:18.480
and procedures we used to govern ourselves and what subject matter we choose in our research

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:30.480
in closing i'd like to emphasize once more than how we define success and how we define excellence is really a matter of our values and beliefs

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:41.340
the initial check for academia at this point is not so much to abandon or will change these traditional beliefs but simply could become

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:51.540
more conscious of them and of their effect on our policies and practices in our professional lives it's one thing to embrace believes that don't serve us well

00:50:51.710 --> 00:51:01.800
but quite another to be largely unaware of their influence in a lot this kind of reflective inquiry into our values and believes is sorely

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:12.020
needed in academia for the past few years we've been working with a group of academics from across the country to explore issues related to meaning purpose

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:22.360
and spirituality and academic work and what we found that despite all of the claims that we're objective pat powers many in

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:32.730
the mouth of the one to talk about these issues but we don't have that then you will have the opportunity the problem is that academic institutions

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:43.640
as currently structured all refuse such opportunities for these conversations around values and beliefs and many institutions actively discourage it i

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:53.860
believe in an open inquiry and most deeply felt values and beliefs to our narrow approach to the findings to the success and a preoccupation

00:51:53.860 --> 00:52:04.310
with acquiring resources and dancing reputation for being smart and being seen by others as smart have affected practically everything we do and

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:14.510
that many of these effects are contrary not only to our best interest as academics but also the educational mission or institution in the larger society

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:25.740
we need to begin a serious discussion of why we present and defining success so narrowly and why we have come to worship merely being smart

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:36.170
as opposed to the value of developing smart guns and we need to consider our concept of smart grids so that it encompasses many

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:40.750
of those qualities that promotes civic life and social responsibility

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:52.640
such discussions and reflections will almost certainly serve us well not only in our efforts to affect a meaningful reforms in our approach to educating under prepared students

00:52:52.960 --> 00:53:03.270
and educating students in general for greater civic responsibility but also to our desire to lead more authentic and productive lives as

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:21.460
academics thanks very much the pittsburgh

it

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:08.620
you never

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.140
know

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:19.440
this is

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.120
registration

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.470
it is

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.490
we are and

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:47.560
more

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.590
it is

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:24.400
can you hear it

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:38.460
yes

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.420
sir

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:53.230
for education it can

00:56:59.160 --> 00:56:59.510
eight

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:06.470
this is

00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:15.830
it

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:26.910
and the reason why

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.160
this is banned

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.140
please be aware

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:09.590
but not necessarily

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.960
right

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:17.230
now

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:49.490
the state

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:09.220
gene

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.350
simmons

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:36.360
and garfunkel technique as just two examples where we have all those remain at the

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:46.490
scientists saying that we want an unusual universities here that responsibility for joe of pages that morning our nod

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:47.880
it

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:51.920
is an active

00:59:54.140 --> 01:00:04.360
the centralization of the valley a river but the point is that collectively and the scots think both the content and the teaching

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:14.650
methods that we use in the light you know those are our conception of statistics that might indeed lead us to make some major revisions in the courtroom and in

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:24.950
the technique that that's so when i have a collaborative morning for example and the others in that very compelling and in the sort of warring both

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:35.550
underutilized techniques that out it seemed the obvious relevance to these issues of democracy in citizenship and community

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:44.200
here is our right to question all

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.460
these bones

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.780
all

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.540
ms binns

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:35.350
so

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.310
hands

01:01:54.890 --> 01:02:05.970
all very effective collaborative learning which is what teaching students is all about one bottle a peer tutoring is another model but they all capitalize

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.460
on on the win win game aspect of this where both the student who's

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:17.530
they were very receptive

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:30.470
literally create more educational resource that by going in the direction of your career and why rick warren and i thought if there

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:40.550
are aspects to this credit was well what we a lot of the high value on teaching each other

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:51.180
and we put a high value on our best students helping to slow or spoons or in the case of service warning we were we put a high value on learning which includes

01:02:51.310 --> 01:03:01.420
serving others and what's what's remarkable about about the research on this is that it appears that both collaborative

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:11.600
learning and service warning are better forms of instruction in terms of the extensive morning development and it turns

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:22.520
out they do have the positive effect of these approaches on some of the citizenship always i was talking about such as leadership which is genetically enhanced by participating

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:32.820
in community service or courts students learn how to get things done they learn how to work together collaboratively to make things happen and that that's a very empowering

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:43.290
experience as well as an opportunity to really check out the theoretical course content as the harp plays out in the real world sometimes is they discovered

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:46.630
a playoff very well much to the chagrin of us that

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:51.080
are

01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.560
here

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.540
gen

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.950
sanchez

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.840
i think that

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:27.470
the value of tenure is limited by the way that we conceive of amusement frankly that you like for me i sort of find

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:37.600
myself fighting the hannah beech maple latino come to ucla o'clock in that way and really wonder if i would be so low one

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:47.750
about some of these things that let it happen you know good question i'm not sure i'd like to think that it would make any difference but i don't know the prom

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:52.270
with tenure is that the people mostly to go hat that that's the problem

01:04:53.860 --> 01:05:02.920
is our youngest most vulnerable people use of the professors who would want a bean says professor actually anymore and a research university

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.330
so in some ways i'll have to wait

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:25.020
till the votes are really brendan intimidated by the process because they don't have a protection and they really didn't steer

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:31.980
their research and they're cleaned your behavior very gingerly police that's like

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:46.120
so i don't know ten year and for sure we have been representative job security and i don't think that really was a really untenable but that's in the way that it's been seen

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:56.280
in and its connection academic freedom think largely lost but for me that's the only value and you're really protect academic freedom

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.910
and whether it doesn't like that was so

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:01.300
young

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:12.070
warriors against terrorism and sentenced them ha ha ha

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:24.160
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha moments bruce dusenberry is being

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:28.060
remade

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.320
these

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:04.170
issues before

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:11.110
based on the reporting

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:16.510
i

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:20.140
really don't

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:36.810
but what we did find is the source of that attack on values is not what we likely that is a roll of wire reason that sort of the in

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:44.340
lawrence's very heavily in iran yeah and fortunately there's some memorable

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.840
characters the major stores and values

01:07:52.990 --> 01:08:03.090
and also sort of different projects that no opportunities that he had a profound effect on certain vowels come mckinnon who for

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:11.670
example connecticut promoting racial understand it as strongly influenced by participation in concert

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:23.230
commitment to own basically the notion of wanting to be a social change at the sense that you can make a guitar that that believe

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:26.530
it straight because most people think that

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:39.430
but those who have the opportunity to experience the service learning actually when they're fully that they became victims

01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:41.990
or abandon their poorly that they can't

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:57.920
see any other hand i did i apologize for my cult following around there was no light on my papers and i'm i was really struggling to see my notes i thought

01:08:58.650 --> 01:09:00.370
that it was thought that

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:09.740
all around here that i can see in the back or in any other hands

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.050
that's

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:17.040
it

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:30.700
this is part of life mr

01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:33.620
tony cardell

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:45.900
they see because it's very important for the value that the joint wanting a joyous top of all this what cities are

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:51.450
they wheeled st louis acknowledges that just that what we do know that reality

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.640
not talking and in relative terms

01:09:56.350 --> 01:10:06.620
you were in a very quantitative it's not the orphans who were not and there are the excessive the germans

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:17.100
would find it the idea that the review that college is to get a better job and make more money and that happened again with these preconceptions of higher education

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:27.220
you know the competitive argument that they were doing so we're and we embrace those viewpoints and of course we're just reinforcing bar that i think

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:32.720
the issue of engaging students who are here are instrumental reasons

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:44.750
is a real challenge but we have some ways are doing our part techniques is united and we mention a couple that clapper wanted very engaging

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:51.380
work in in my five years and i take responsibility for your

01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.090
reporting

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:12.570
there is a tremendous deterrent effect here are basically trying to collaborate we provide a meaningful servants who are

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.070
not very common experiences as constance investor warren are in progress

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:24.390
and fire it like

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.830
ha ha ha it's be

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.590
nice but

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:57.730
but

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:10.280
see again the police here is a really interesting is that typically and change in ways that sell one property think about how much equity

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.960
you're going to exert on behalf of the change over that you don't think of them were

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:26.150
very unstable is the whole point of the evening they literally shape your experience your weekly experience shaped always going to work your

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:34.910
way as well you know so we'd be a net so that our spiritual or we think about police were supported wire rims we go right

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:47.340
then and so i think really there we believe we can change our institutions weekend interview because we have the tools are a process that

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.460
happens slowly and resistance

01:12:51.690 --> 01:13:00.900
to change an institution is the best evidence that you're making progress paradox a resistance

01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:17.890
the pain
