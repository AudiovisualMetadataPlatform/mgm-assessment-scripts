it's my very distinct pleasure to welcome you all to the second lecture of this week  it's customary to say  think about thinking about really some 4000-5000 students who would be graduating this year and maybe walking around campus today and thinking wouldn't it be nice if somebody would come and give his or her impressions about this year to us  well if you take yourself back 1893 a student from here graduated and I do not know exactly what she was thinking but that wouldn't it be nice if people Scholars  come outside Bloomington would come and share their experience research results with us maybe from New York maybe from the west coast and when did midnight Bloomington to enjoy and learn and learn from them  about 40 years down the road he made a request which has grown and we just feeling at  some other monies have been added to it which makes it possible for us to invite people like Alexander asked you to come here and share his research results with us was William Catholic  I invite now from the Department of English Mastiff  address for Erica Campbell  don't ever ask his contribution to our understanding about to the American diversity education  let's go to the research encompasses the Administrative Professionals over the past 40 years  is it a ship with major organization of the skeleton students of higher education to massive annual survey of freshmen who founded the directions to more than 30 years of longest-running research program by the way in American higher education provided an extraordinary collection of data on the road ends  staff experienced extraordinary productivity and unique Insight that shape and improve the work done by those who dedicated their career as a serving and better understanding needs a factory  music for a college PhD in Psychology from University of Maryland at the only positions of the National Merit Scholarship Corporation and is directed research regarding Council education UCLA.

Only by the back of the school of education for psychology and philosophy study in business and spear as well as numerous administrators of the Kansas level so very pleased we will deliver the keynote address for the Daniels are going to the podium. Because you know what kind of Student Success is if we want to promote a joint  thanks everybody I hope I can manage this thing without dropping it when he see here okay  does that do it good  can y'all hear me in the back all right okay  I'm going to put the light on here so I can see  as we all know we've traditionally Define Student Success in terms of what while the student is in college in terms of the time-honored grade point average or if we want to do a minimal kind of a successful passing courses and finishing a degree program  and if you want to look at it at high-level we've defined it in terms of a receiving honors the various kinds  and then after college we look at success in terms of such things as entry to graduate school or or perhaps up what kind of graduate school you're able to enter how he'll eat it is or whether we get a job and especially what kind of job and indeed how much it pays earnings have been used in many cases as measures of success but these are all in one way or another traditional academic measures or vocational measure earnings for example is Isis this is probably the equivalent in a sense of the gpa post-college equivalent software so these things are all connected academic and Vocational  measures of success now the premise of my talk this afternoon is it while there's nothing inherently wrong or sinful about these traditional measures they are simply not enough  and if we persist in linking our conception of Student Success or limiting our conception of Student Success in this way  we are selling short not only our institutions and our students but also the society that supports has  let me try to explain why I believe this is so  there's mounting evidence that the quality of Civic life and Civic engagement in the United States has been eroding in recent years but what's the problem is is a long one and I don't want to belabor it but let me just review of mention a few of these things shaky race relations growing economic disparities and inequities excessive materialism decaying inner cities a deteriorating infrastructure a weakening public school system and are responsible mass media declining Civic engagement and the increasing in in the increasing effect excuse 50 decreasing effectiveness of governmental agencies and people to name just a few in a democracy of course citizen disengagement from politics and government ineffectiveness not only go hand-in-hand but also crippled our capacity  to educate each new generation of leaders and government business  La medicine the clergy and other Advanced professions  since our colleges and universities educate each new generation of leaders in these fields and trained all the Personnel who teach the entire population at the pre-collegiate level  we in the higher education Community must bear some responsibility for the societal problems that the sterbis so much  apparently our graduates are not successful enough in these other areas to begin to solve the social problems and indeed may have become a part of a problem  and considering that are higher education system is generally regarded as the finest one in the world we need to ask ourselves where have we gone wrong  the more I reflect on the problems confronting higher education in the larger society the more I become convinced that at the heart of these problems  in trying to effect positive social change is a question of beliefs in as those of you who heard me Tuesday night will know and this is sort of my current preoccupation  by this I mean not only our beliefs about what Student Success means but also our beliefs about the meaning and purpose of a liberal education and our view of our view of the role of higher education should play in the larger society to speak of success means very little and makes little sense unless we also consider the issue of success to what end  in other words our beliefs about Student Success are closely tied to our beliefs about the purposes of education and the role of higher education in the society  the problem is not just with our beliefs about these matters but also that these beliefs remain largely unexamined and unexposed while we discuss and debate the educational policies and practices that emanate from them  why we are educating our students has to do with the relationship between higher education and Society  but different people hold very different views about this relationship and it's important that we Expose and identify and recognize and honor these different views an extreme view which would probably be endorsed by only a small number of Hardcore academic elitist such as perhaps Robert Maynard Hutchins is it the university should remain walled off from the external world of practical Affairs so students can learn and study and faculty can pursue Truth undisturbed by worldly distractions and I would call list the the Ivory Tower of you of what we're all about  now the Ivory Tower concept might have a certain peel peel for some of my academic colleagues and I must admit I know a few for whom it has a great deal of appeal it could not end never will represent a viable conception of higher education and its role in modern American society like it or not higher education is a creature of society is sanctioned and supported by that society and has intern pledged itself to serve that society and its mission statements and catalogs and other public pronouncements another words were sort of on on the hook here  in our rhetoric  an alternative belief system which seems to dominate in discussions of educational policy these days is what I perhaps uncharitably like to call the pegboard view of what we're trying to do  Under the pegboard view Student Success is judged in terms of how prepared the student is for work  the pegboard you also is what drives what I like to call the the competitiveness argument so I'll put these up here together. Because they are twins  this is the dominant belief system not only have our captives are captains of industry but also of most politicians and policymakers not to mention many students teachers and parents  the idea here is in higher education must deliver more people with expertise in science technology and modern management techniques so that America's economy can remain competitive with the economies of Western Europe and especially with the emerging economies on the Pacific Rim  my main problem with a pegboard and content and competitiveness of use is that they represent an extremely limited conception not only have the role of higher education but also of what's the larger society is all about when we consider the major problems plaguing our society  it's very difficult to imagine how the pegboard view in the competitive you are going to contribute much to this simply to fill job slots in the labor market certainly is not going to do the trick when it comes to dealing with problems such as are decaying inner cities to our racial problems to the inequities in the distribution of wealth and so forth  now a close cousin of the pegboard view is what I like to call the private economic benefit view where the consumer Viewpoint about what we're all about  and this this particular Viewpoint argues that the purpose of higher education is to enable people to lead more affluent and comfortable lives in a lot of politicians like to Advocate this view is sort of a populist view as they see it where the more education you get the more money you can make and even rationalize it in terms of productivity arguments having to do with the productivity  even if we were to accept the argument that private economic benefits provide the main justification for our existence as educational institutions this particular belief system is extremely limited because it has little to say about how society as a whole is served by such an approach in other words why it may be a lot of old goal to contribute to the economic comfort and well-being of those citizens who are fortunate enough to enter incomplete higher education this Viewpoint has little to say about what's going to happen to people who don't go to college or complete College North it doesn't say anything about how if at all the many other social and economic problems that I've mentioned earlier will be addressed by such an approach  I'm entirely different kind of belief system is implied in the various public pronouncements that I've already alluded to that we make in our mission statements and catalogs in the presidential state of the college reports and so forth in many ways the sometimes lofty statements comes closest anyting the John Dewey is conception of the proper role of Education in society if we were to study the mission statement so in fact we've some of our graduate students have done this the mission statements of a randomly selected group of American higher education institutions we would sell them if ever find any mention of private economic benefits International competitiveness or filling slots in the labor market  on the contrary when it comes to describing its educational Mission the typical College University will use such language as preparing students for responsible citizenship developing character developing Future Leaders preparing students to serve society and so on in other words if we're to believe our own rhetoric those of us who work in the academy see ourselves as serving the society and of promoting and strengthening our particular form of democratic self-government  we might refer to this as the citizenship or the service concept of our mission  what such a belief system does not preclude individual economic benefits or filling slots in the labor market or enhancing economic competitiveness  the central focus is on responsible citizenship and service  the citizenship view I would argue implies a much broader conception of Student Success then do the other views  clearly the manner in which we approach this issue of Student Success will depend heavily on which of these belief systems we embrace  success implies one thing if we see ourselves simply as helping young people to lead more comfortable and affluent lives but quite another thing if we see ourselves as working together to strengthen our society in our democracy  given the current state of our democracy in our society I would argue that we have no choice but to embrace this with you  the problem of course is it if you look at the typical American college or university its curriculum in his Co curriculum it's teaching and Personnel practices and the values that govern is administrative policies it's very difficult find much evidence of a core commitment to Preparing students for responsible citizenship most institutions have simply not put their citizenship and service commitments into practice  despite the growing interest in service and Civic engagement within the academy in this is a a very healthy development it seems to me there's a lot more we can do to renew and Revitalize Civic engagement and democracy in the US in the classroom for example we can start giving more attention to the development of those personal qualities which are crucial to Civic life and effective Democratic self-government and by this I mean quality such as self understanding you know that's kind of at the basis of all the great philosophical and religious traditions where is it in the curriculum I have a hard time finding it self understanding listening skills  leadership empathy honesty generosity the the ability to work collaboratively  most of these qualities exemplify aspects of what Daniel goleman would call emotional intelligence we can also begin to introduce the concept of civic responsibility and citizenship in The Faculty discussions of curricular reform such a shift in our curricular discussions would be easy to justify given the fact that is I've said are catalogs and mission statements are all full of that kind of rhetoric  and give him some very promising current developments in the curriculum area and I'm thinking here of the emphasis on multiculturalism in the environment just as two examples we can also build on these efforts by introducing general education content that focuses more directly on issues of Contemporary American Civic life and democracy and what do I mean by this the central role of information and the mass media theory of democracy says you don't have an informed electorate it doesn't work but I don't think the mass media are exactly without problems in this area the possible causes of declining Civic engagement and declining trust in government the escalating role of money in politics the growing corporate influence and so on the long list of these and we can do much more to institutionalize service-learning both in the general education curriculum in the major and I think we should all do this  and those who complain that requiring service diminishes at all I can say is do we diminish English comp by requiring it do we we require what we value  so we make a value statement when we require something with student what I'm really suggesting here is that we can begin to broaden our conception of Student Success to include a genuine commitment on the part of the institutions to renewing Civic life and Civic engagement in American society  and we can manifest that commitment by embracing significant changes in our curriculum teaching practices reward system community relations and most importantly in the values and beliefs that guide our policies and practices  I might add here that are narrow definition of Student Success is in many ways parallel to our narrow approach to defining success  in the research universities we pay lip service to the importance of teaching mentoring and University Service but the fact is that the faculty success is defined nearly exclusively in many places in terms of research and scholarship by default important faculty talents like good colleague ship which are so critical to creating a real academic Community get little or no wait in judging the professional success of our colleagues  in my patent lecture on Tuesday evening  I discussed our traditional beliefs about what makes our institutions excellent and forgive me for repeating myself but they're a lot more people here tonight this afternoon so at least I better refresh you remembering this is of course The Gospel According to Sandy so I don't mind preaching at once more  most of us to find her excellence in terms of either of their the resources that we have and I've got a new charge here for you guys who were here Tuesday evening this is an equation now I'm getting quantitative about this  where we to find her excellence in terms of what we have and what others think of us this is what I would call the egocentric approach to defining excellence in and up  and while and while there's nothing inherently wrong we have to have resources to function and we have to have reputations to attract students and faculty when we concentrate on these as the end as the ultimate definition of our Excellence we again diminish and end and devalue student learning  and as I had argued Tuesday night that's what we really need to move toward is a concept of Excellence based on how effectively were able to educate our students but Effectiveness and Student Success being seen in much broader terms  my concern about the reputation when resources conception is that they fail to address directly are basic societal purposes of teaching and public service not that we don't need these resources reputation but paradoxically it can also cause us to neglect our research Mission this is the irony of it because we become more focused on acquiring restore balance then in nurturing in developing the research Talent that's already there  the roots of three of our most intractable problems in Academia I would argue can be found in this preoccupation with resource acquisition and reputational enhancement let me just quickly review these cuz they're familiar to all of us and yet we don't normally think about them in terms of how they are products of our belief system about what makes us excellent  for example the valuing of research over teaching  and the struggle between equity and excellence and the issue of individualism vs Community are all in one way or another connected to our beliefs about the importance of acquiring more resources in enhancing our reputation we value research more than teaching because we believe that outstanding scientists and Scholars will add more to our reputation and resources then we'll outstanding teachers or mentors and when we Define our excellence in terms of the test scores of the entering students the High student high-scoring student things you hear as a resource which I find interesting that enhances our reputation  we set our sense of excellence in direct conflict with our desire to promote educational opportunities for those groups in our society whose test scores put them at a competitive disadvantage  finally when we place the highest value on the individual Scott Ali accomplishments of our students and faculty we reinforce their competitive and individual individualistic Tendencies making it very difficult for them to develop those qualities that help promote a sense of community on the campus and again I mean good colleague ship collaboration community service citizenship and social responsibility these latter qualities of course are the same ones that are needed to make any democracy work  if we really mean it when we claim the education is our Central Mission then student learning should be at the heart of our conception of Excellence I like to call this the Civic or Talent Development review of  what our mission is all about  however even if we accept his talent development few we still need to answer the question which talents and to what end  as I consider all the ways in which are traditional of beliefs about excellence and Student Success interfere with their ability to improve and strengthen Civic life in American society no problem strikes me as being more important than the education of the so-called remedial for underprepared student  Now by examining this issue in some dip we can begin to see how it might be possible for higher education institutions not need to broaden our conception of Student Success but also to become more effective agents of positive social change  if we fail to develop more effective interventions for our so-called remedial or developmental students will find it very difficult to make much Headway in resolving some of our most pressing social and economic problems in by this I mean unemployment crime welfare Healthcare racial tensions the maldistribution of wealth and citizen disengagement from the political process  I say this first because underprepared students are have historically been the ones most likely to drop out of at any level of education and second because persons with relatively low levels of educational attainment account for a disproportionate number of welfare recipients prison inmates poor people be unemployed and people who don't vote  Beyond this the issue of race relations in affirmative action are intimately connected to the issue under preparation since we have created a competitive hierarchical system which dispenses privilege on the basis of measures Here We Come Again With a success measures the GPA and the test scores that put our two largest racial minority groups at a competitive disadvantage  if our educational system allocated its resources more equitably across these various groups by socioeconomic and race measures there'd be little need for affirmative action  it goes without saying that the underprepared student is a kind of pariah in American higher education and some of the reasons are obvious since most of us believe that our Excellence depends on enrolling more and more of the very best prepared students  to admit underprepared students would pose a real threat to our sense of Excellence why would any sane institution want to do this  but here the public institutions encounter a bit of a dilemma since the law and many states requires that at least some underprepared students be given an opportunity to pursue post-secondary education how can this be done so we don't put our Excellence at risk the answer of course is it we've created hierarchy of public systems where the least well-prepared students are consigned either two community colleges or two relatively non-selective public colleges and when selective institutions find themselves forced to admit a few went to prepare students for example to maintain competitiveness in division 1A Athletics  and trust me on this there ain't nobody more underprepared then division 1A Revenue Sports athletes  they likewise avoid having much contact with these students by hiring part-time tutors and in part-time instructors from the outside to do the work  these tracking practices exert a subtle but powerful influence on the attitudes and beliefs of our students and indeed of the larger society  who are probably going to be influenced much more by what we do in our admissions process for example then by what we say about such things as equality of opportunity or multiculturalism or educational equity  by practicing selective admissions using these gnarly to find measures of Student Success we're sending important value messages we don't value the education of the students with the lower scores and we send this message not only to our own students but also to the remedial students who can we reject to those who must teach them into the larger society no wonder the teaching underprepared students is viewed as I'm glamorous unimportant and in many institutions the meaning  why do why do underprepared students make us so uncomfortable  is it just that they're more difficult to teach which I believe they are and that their presence on campus threatens our sense of Excellence where are there deeper reasons  while our beliefs about Student Success and the importance of resource acquisition and reputational enhancement are fairly obvious we can see these upon a little bit of reflection  there are other beliefs that we Harbor as academics and that have tremendous effects on our practices that are largely unacknowledged much less critically examined  and one of these beliefs and forgive me if those you read my Chronicle of Higher Education tirade on this  one of these beliefs I like to characterize as the importance of being smart  now this may sound flippant but I think if you think about it for a while for tickly in terms of your of your experience in this institution or any other perhaps you'll see a little of what I mean there many other terms I could use for smart istay Brilliance creativity intelligence and so bored but for the purposes of our discussion here also use them or flippant term smartness my many years has a scholar of higher education is an employee of a research University not unlike this one convinces me that much of our fear of remedial students and much of our unwillingness to get involved and educating them can be traced to our uncritical acceptance of this belief into the fact that most of us are not even consciously aware of the power and scope of its influence  most of us clearly favor our brightest students not only an admissions but in the award of financial aid and also in the classroom if bright students enroll at our institutions and take our classes then this reflect well on our own brightness surely we must be smart if our students are so smart  but if our students are not so smart then this reflects poorly on us this may help to explain why so many academics keep a very close eye on the average test scores of the entering freshman if our students are getting smarter than were reassured about our own smartness but if they're getting Dumber our sense of our own smartness is threatened no wonder we hire others to teach remedial students or simply avoid them all together through selective admissions  the real problem here is that we value being smart much more than we do developing smartness  if our Relentless and largely unconscious preoccupation with being smart  we forget that our institutions primary mission is to develop intellectual capacities and other capacities of our students not merely to select and certify those whose intellectual Talent are already brought well developed by the time they come to us this preoccupation with being smart is also part of the reason why we continue to use measures of Student Success the GPA and the standardized test score that are geared to ranking and rating students rather than to reflecting how much they're actually learning  we all know students who get AIDS and our courses who didn't put out on the effort who didn't learn much but they were very smart and very bright and very clever when they came to us and they're able to get through our exams  I've already suggested that these assessment devices but tickly the standardized test imply a very narrow standard of smartness  but they're also a little value either in helping students to learn or in helping us to evaluate the success of our pedagogical efforts  we were inflicted the same normative approach to assessing students on the lower schools such the politicians and the public now evaluate the quality of the schools simply on the basis of which ones have the smartest students rather than on the basis of which ones are the most effective educational and I mean this affected even in terms of this narrow standard of smartness  this approach not only does violence to the wonderful diversity of student Talent by forcing them all onto a single continuum  but it's also  it also has the effect of sending a message to the relatively low scoring student you're dumb you're lazy you're not College material it's no wonder so many students drop out of the educational system before they ever reach college-age  a simplistic yardstick like the SAT or the ACT is used by many of us as the principal indicator of the student's ability or Sparta Martinez  but by doing this we implicitly diminish the great social and cultural importance of the citizenship talents that I've mentioned such as empathy self-understanding honesty responsibility leadership and the ability to work collaboratively I'm not adhere that this narrow approach to defining and assessing Talent OR Merit has been turned against us with considerable success by the opponents of affirmative action  I think it will be very difficult to challenge these traditional Notions about Student Success and educational Excellence unless we do it collectively while American college and universities can be justifiably proud of their diversity and their autonomy a collection of 3,000 institutions simply doing their individual things does not necessarily make for a coherent or effective system  the problem is not that we're all so wonderfully different and diverse but rather that the sum total of our individual uncoordinated efforts doesn't always add up to a meaningful whole  what I'm really asking here is if we're going to presistin defining or Excellence solely in institutional terms or are we going to be willing to bite the bullet and take a systems perspective  let me see if I can explain what I mean by this  unless we can sit down together and collectively begin to discuss our systems responsibilities toward the society  our efforts to become excellent as individual institutions will continue to support our efforts to achieve real educational Excellence as a system  if nothing else in an extended inter-institutional conversation about the issues that I've been mentioning here at the systems level would make it clear that all of us and higher education not to mention the rest of the society have a heavy stake in broadening our conception of Student Success and in redefining our concept of what makes us excellent and in particular on the priority that we must assign to the Effective Education of the underprepared student  at the state and systems and local levels we have to sit down together all types of Institutions and begin a serious discussion of our mutual ambivalence about remediation and under preparation  these institutional conversations could also cover a number of other related issues the cry out for collaborative effort coordination and expansion of community service and service-learning programs Community needs local governmental problems diversity and multiculturalism sharing of resources admissions transfer credits and so forth but the one that cries out most urgently for attention is the underprepared or remedial student  the necessary for us to move away from a purely competitive and individualistic mindset what's good for our institution and to adopt more of a collaborative or consortial approach to defining Student Success into the under preparation problem becomes clearer when we consider what might happen if one of us were to try to go It Alone  as long as the different college and universities in a state continue to operate independently and to persist in their traditional beliefs about excellence and in the case of IUI would say not to States but a region the Big Ten region any institution automatically puts its excellent at risk if it unilaterally decides to broaden its conception of success and to admit substantially greater numbers of underprepared students or to invest substantially more of its resources and educating such students  if we could be successful in stimulating the kinds of systems discussions of these issues that I'm envisioning hear the conversation would soon begin to focus on the various arguments that we traditionally used to defend selective admissions for example of frequently used defense is what I like to call the prediction argument  now to put this in a nutshell the prediction argument says that we defend the use of these narrow conceptions of student talent and success the GPA and the test score on the grounds that they predict performance in college  and indeed they do predict but the prediction is less than ideal but they do prediction this is undeniably the case  now imagine  what would happen if our Medical Healthcare System where to take the same approach to its admissions policies  and I talked parallel here between medicine and Health Care on the one hand and education on the other because we're always using industrial analog and their prediction argument makes sense and the case of the business it's trying to compete with other businesses and wants to hire the best talent to exploit that talent for its own purposes to succeed in competition but this model simply doesn't make sense for education and I think by illustrating this with a medical analog you can see what I mean because under that kind of a system we would have a large number of Hospitals and Clinics that are underfunded  that are poorly staff that have poor facilities and that enroll sickest patients  we would then have a smaller group of Institute of clinics and hospitals that would have better facilities and better paid staff and so forth which admitted patients with a moderately severe illnesses and then I'm going to have a small group of elite clinics and hospitals with the best paid and best trained staff and all the best and most modern equipment which admitted only patients with common cold  and that would make a lot of sense in the Healthcare System  what public interest what civic interest is served by concentrating the least well-prepared students in the institutions with the least resources  how can such an arrangement be rationalized in terms of the larger interests of the community in the society the fact of the matter is that it can't  to see why this is so we can again use analogy for medicine  and I think in the case of of of medicine we would create  a massive number of untreated or poorly treated  people who would then cause us to go broke if you will trying to rehabilitate them they wouldn't be capable of working their families would break up and go broke trying to pay for their eye treatment on a private basis and so forth so it seems to me that in just the same way that not valuing the education of the underprepared student by the way we structure institutions we're creating the same kind of problem for ourselves later on  now if we took more of a systems approach to defining Student Success and to confronting the problems under preparations it's important to keep in mind that our greatest untapped resource maybe the students from cell  there's probably no other group that's better suited to tutoring underprepared students then they're better prepared peers  if I appear to drink could be built into the curriculum in a systematic fashion everyone would benefit  more pedagogical resources would be invested in the education of the underprepared and the better prepared students would have an opportunity to master course material in Greater depth by teaching it to others  as I said in a couple of meetings earlier today I don't think I get Dumber teaching students who don't know what I know  maybe I do I don't know  you're such a mentoring and tutoring program were expanded to include a variety of service learning opportunities for example for students to work with underprepared students in the public schools the bonds between higher education in the local community would be greatly strengthened  the problems that are plaguing our contemporary democracy art and in many respects the same problems that de tocqueville identified more than a century-and-a-half ago and that is the tension between individualism and community and its acted out at the institutional level by our individual competitiveness and Quest For Greater Excellence we want to move up in the pecking order and a push others down  this tension is exacerbated by the mistaken belief that we are independent of and separate from each other even our most recent research on students some of which I talked about Tuesday night highlights the importance of community the single most important source of influence on the individual student turns out to be the peer group  in light of the reduced funding and other external pressures that we are experiencing today though it seems only fair to ask  do we have the wherewithal to undertake the kinds of new Ventures I've been suggesting this afternoon  in our haste to man the barricades to defend ourselves against external threats we're inclined to forget that the autonomy that we seek to protect may be the most powerful tool that we have for reshaping our Notions of Student Success and institutional Excellence more in the direction of promoting democracy and citizenship there's nobody standing in our way of doing this except ourselves  the fact remains in this is what we tend to forget that we still retain control over practically all the decisions that really matter  home to admit and how to admit them what courses and what work to require of our students what to teach how to teach it how we assess and evaluate our students how we Define their success how we structure are co-curricular programs how we hire reward and 10-year are colleagues what policies and procedures we use to govern ourselves and what subject matter we choose in our research  enclosing I'd like to emphasize once more than how we define success and how we Define Excellence is really a matter of our values and beliefs the initial check for Academia at this point is not so much to abandon or change these traditional beliefs but simply to become more conscious of them and of their effect on our policies and practices in our professional lives  it's one thing to embrace beliefs that don't serve us well but quite another to be largely unaware of their influence in our lives this kind of reflective inquiry into our values and beliefs is sorely needed in Academia for the past few years we've been working with a group of academics from across the country to explore issues related to meaning purpose and spirituality and academic work and what we found is despite all of the claims we are objective detached Scholars  many indeed most of us want to talk about these issues but we don't have the venues we don't have the opportunities the problem is that I could demek institutions as currently structured offer few such opportunities for these conversations around values and beliefs and many institutions actively discourage it I believe in an open inquiry into our most deeply felt values and beliefs  up to our narrow approach to defining Student Success and our preoccupation with acquiring resources and enhancing reputations being smart and being seen by others as smart as effective practically everything we do and that many of these effects are contrary not only to our best interests as academics but also to the educational mission of our institution in the larger society we need to begin a serious discussion of why we persist in defining success so narrowly and why we have come to worship merely being smart as opposed to the value of developing smartness  and we need to consider our concept of smartness so that it encompasses many of those qualities that promote Civic life and social responsibility  such discussions and Reflections will almost certainly serve as well not only in our efforts to affect the meaningful reforms in our approach to educating underprepared students and to educating students in general for greater civic responsibility but also to our desire to lead more authentic and productive lives as academics thanks very much  that's all right I just a couple of announcements before we take the president provides 100% service to students on this campus  thank you for your brother. I just wanted to quickly remind you and hope that many of you in the room with that are here the part of the 17th annual Spring Symposium on promoting Student Success fostering academic in an increasing persistence the graduation automatically putting all kinds of messages together I apologize come together to talk about issues in student learning and campus climate there is a reception after this program at 5:30 for all of those who are at this lecture today and also going to be a part of the Symposium and then tomorrow we have the whole series of programs beginning here at 9 and then turning on through the day with the actually three sets of concurrent sessions over 17 different presentations  involving a 45 different themes involving colleagues from around the campus telling you what they're doing in the classroom and what they're doing outside the classroom to make the university environment in Bloomington a stimulating an educational experience as it can possibly be for our students so if you wandered into the lecture this afternoon and didn't necessarily know this was also a part of a symposium registration is instantaneous speed of the schedule just outside the door tomorrow morning we'll have him outside the door so 8:15 in the morning you can show up here for a continental breakfast and then get a schedule of the day's programs and activities we hope to see you at least as many folks in the morning as we have here now we'll start with a panel presentation and then move into the various topics of the day so thank you for coming to the Past lecture this afternoon to thank you also for  in the symposium  I'm fascinated that you that you're right knowledge that the police are important part of higher education and as you suggested our policy should reply  what you better come down here cuz I don't think the Acoustics can you hear him yes or no  there's plenty of court so my question concerns your emphasis on beliefs and I'm wondering when you suggest that our policies and institutions of Higher Learning should reflect certain beliefs how you make the decision which beliefs are included in which armed because you said honesty is an important belief for education but if I add a person would say you know we should be honest because the Lord Jesus Christ as let your yea be yea or nay be nay that would probably be considered a nap and led to the higher education system that I've experienced so how do you make that decision which values are working to policy in which ones are not  now that's a great question and I think the distinction between what kinds of success he was fouled becoming more honest balionis Timor and the reasons why you was found when he meets her own reasons for this and I think that's less important than then we have some kind of collective discussion to to see what are common values are and I've suggested that some of these do have to do with the human qualities that make for Effective parents and respected citizens and we know what some of these are and it seems to me whether we are trying to or not we do in fact about some of these towns but we don't explicitly any case for example that leadership skills are developed a fairly well in some kind of Institutions but not necessarily as a result of some kind of conscious intention to do so  sort of a byproduct  what you've done is describe the problem on the Titanic iceberg on the horizon the boat is headed but the bird is there but you haven't suggested the means by which to avoid the crash positions of the national government we don't have the money in our pocket when we don't have the well to be independent  arm the system is more complex than than your description of the hell you would propose beginning to turn the shutter but if you just take two issues of curriculum content in pedagogical technique as as two examples where we have almost free ring pickling the general education program to design this anyway we want is Not Unusual University Square that responsibility for general education is vested more in the department so it's not odd maybe unusual way to put it out there other institution to do this and that gives certain certain decentralisation of the general education program but the point is sitting down collectively And discussing both the content and the teaching methods that we use in the light of this broader conception of Student Success  indeed lead us to make some major revisions in the curriculum content of the teaching techniques that's that's sort of what I have in mind Collaborative Learning for example if I'm in service-learning both underutilized techniques that have it seems me obvious relevance to these issues of democracy and citizenship in the community  it's exciting that the least to hear something the title can of worms be no going to have to learn how I can go back and there's disappointed I get them then after they have failed that sometimes learn some content and rather than spend most of my time and I spent all the time in behavior and I wonder how much research we were actually doing that uses  instead of looking at 2 for judging by their results actually spend time and I know where you Excel Excel more by teaching us so that we concentrate on you it's a question how we learn and I wonder if there's money mean spending perhaps maybe you could describe some where were actually involving the process of completing other students and how that can happen that I need vampires of a very effective Collaborative Learning which is what it was teaching students is all about that's one model a peer tutoring is another model that they all capitalized on on the win-win game aspect of this we're both the student whose teaching or tutoring and the tootsie or these two new the recent recipient benefit from this so we literally create more  educational Resources by going in the direction of peer tutoring and Collaborative Learning and if there are other aspects to this that are critical as well as we symbolizing or institution when we put a high value on teaching each other when we put a high value on our best students helping the slower students or in the case of service-learning we where we put a high value on learning which includes serving others  and what's what's remarkable about about the research on this is that it appears that both Collaborative Learning and service-learning are better forms of instruction in terms of the extent of Student Learning and Development and as it turns out they do have positive effects both of these approaches on some of these citizenship qualities I was talking about such as leadership which is tremendously enhance by participating in community service as part of a course students learn how to get things done they learn how to work together collaboratively to make things happen and that's that's a very empowering experience as well as an opportunity to really check out the theoretical course content as to how it plays out in the real world sometimes they discover a dozen play Offspring  way back in the way back here  I think that the value of tenure is limited by the way that we conceived of it and use it frankly but you don't like for me I sort of find myself biting the hand that feeds me a lot you know coming from UCLA and talking this way  and I really wonder if I would be so blunt about some of these things if I didn't have time to run around with a good question I'm not sure I'd like to think that it wouldn't make any difference but I don't know the problem with tenure is at the people who most need it don't have it that's that's that's the problem  is that our youngest most vulnerable people assistant professors I don't know who would want to be an assistant professor actually anymore in a research University seems like I didn't want to do that but I really I wonder about that in some ways it's kind of untenable situations but it's so these these folks are really threatened and intimidated by the process because they don't have any protection and they really do steer their research and their collegial behavior very gingerly at least that's my experience with assistant professors  so I don't know 10-year unfortunately has been represented as job security and I don't think that's really was ever the intent of it but that seems to be the way that it's been the scene in and its connection to academic freedom seems to have been largely lost but for me that's the only value of tenure really is is to protect academic freedom in the weather it does I got some questions about it so young looking good on a college for 18 year olds look pretty much do the same kind of people and 20 years later there was no difference between intended for your College Dropout  Honda recall college graduates did more beer drinking problem is reason and because of the game doctors and lawyers Engineers that determines the most kinds of things that you called civic responsibility and is there anything to her it's really showed it make a difference if one goes  yeah they had to do with Jacob's much cited book based on Research done in the 50s I believe that these early 60s which one of the things that college is really don't change people's values very much and that's not what we find but what we do find is it for the source of that effect on values is not what we like to think it is I think for a lot of lot of reasons of the source of the influence is very heavily the peer group  and fortunately there's some measurable fagley in and also the service learning experience with Jacobs had no opportunity to study has a profound effect on certain values commitment to Ferg's and commitment to promoting racial understanding is is strongly influenced by participation in community service and commitment to the notion of wanting to be a social change agent the sense that you can make a difference that that belief is strengthened because most students don't think they can make a difference  but to those who have the opportunity to experience that service-learning actually strengthen their belief that they they can make a difference or abandon their police to say can't  I see any other hand I apologize for my kind of public around here there was no light on my papers and I'm I was really struggling to see my note it was stopped to see him so I kind of fumbled around a few times there but it I can't see in the back here that's what I Associated to any other hands  here's one alright  advantage of the resources office  you find on your research yeah that this is part of the trends I talked about on Tuesday night that that the students are not the since coming to college today are less inclined to see the college experience for its intrinsic value that is the joy of learning and the joy of self-development this sort of thing it's just that you don't seem to acknowledge that an adjusted what we do to that reality and I'm talking in in relative terms now there's plenty of students who who who are in a very inclined get engaged or just not as many as are you who are not and that's part of the kind of excessive materialism of the society as I see at the idea that the reason you go to college just to get a better job and make more money and that has to do again with these different conceptions of higher education the you know the competitive his argument the pegboard you and so forth  and if we Embrace those you points and of course we're just reinforcing these problems but I think the issue of engaging students who are here for instrumental reason is a real challenge but we have some ways of doing it and I would like to talk about some of those one of those techniques Tuesday night but and we mentioned a couple today Collaborative Learning is very engaged because students know their work is going to be scrutinized by their peers  and they take responsibility for their peers learning to a certain extent same thing with community service work in the context of course there is a tremendous pure group effect here of basically trying to collaboratively provide it a meaningful service to two others  and that's a very powerful experience for students who had service learning experience is pretty impressive  and faculty members for that you'll like it  Siri what kind of reception you get the colonists when you proposed  lifetime custom team  well I'm not going to feed Barber that's beyond  that's beyond anybody's capabilities  but  when were talking about police here is a really interesting issue is that if you don't believe you can change the place that's a self-fulfilling prophecy needs to think about it think how much effort you're going to exert on behalf of a change effort if you don't think it's going to work  it's very interesting that your beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecy mean they literally shape your experience didn't we think experience shakes police but it works the other way as well you know we behave as so that our experience will support her beliefs because if our beliefs were supported by our experience we go crazy  and and so I think the me that if we believe we can change our institutions we can damn sure do it because we have the tools it's a learning process that will happen slowly and resistance  to change efforts in an institution is the best evidence that you're making progress that's the Paradox of resistance  spank  join him at the reception the University Club and if you have questions to ask him privately first place
