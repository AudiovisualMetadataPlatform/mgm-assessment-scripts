xvii  this morning demonstrators blocked access to the Bryan administration building and after that picket lines were established around Valentine and brawls Halls by students met with a group of administrative this morning and agreed to maintain open picket lines committing these students who desire to attend classes at least access until this meeting took place now coming onto the podium or on the stage we see President Sutton transport Carter as a moderator of this afternoon's meeting professor of Harry Potter  also Seated on the stage is student body of law  and I hope to be able to be literally  a moderator for this meeting  I've been on the campus at Brian Hall since 7:30 in the morning  I know there are deep divisions Among Us  quite frequently during the day  students were asked what their plans were  students were asked what's likely to happen  I heard one response  that response was it is up to the individual conscience of the end of the person is up to his moral conscience  that explanation is appealing to me I consider the moral conscience to be the most legitimate source of values and actions  and because I heard that praise because I am committed to it I to want to appeal to your moral conscience  I asked even though there are divisions Among Us  I understand the feelings are lacerated I understand we are living in a tense world I understand some of the ugliness that's occurred on campuses and in the rest of the world and I also understand that there is hope for the world that there are occasions when certain differences must be set aside if there is any chance of agreement of understanding about a building a better world we must not lose those aspects of civilization we have gained for so long  this Society is sick and very many ways but it is not incurable and we are gathered together today to make one manifestation of rationality we can learn we can talk we can discuss we can exchange we can build be better for it with your leader use the word love it done Metals we use the word peace but use the word people and I ask you to remember those words I asked you to convert this an occasion that we can all be proud of  first then we'll be a statement  my cousin and sucking then a statement by Chancellor Carter  then I understand the student leaders will make statements then I hope to be able to recognize people from the floor your recognized no matter how fair I want to be no matter how much I will want to recognize people of different views how difficult this will be for me in the sense we must discipline ourselves in this audience I should also announce that is the kind of meeting that we must have a time limit  April be there are issues which I don't think I can be talked over and over again I hope that in the hour allowed it an hour from the first Speaker we will be able to clarify enough let us see what happens in the hour let us agree the first that we will last talked last for an hour  I think something has to be understood right now that this meeting is for the benefit of the students and I feel that for students to get as much out of this the moderator should be a student  and we can we can supply a student from the law school to moderate so lost it will still be in moderation  that was Keith Parker making a move that's indicated that he wanted a student to moderate this afternoon's meeting there's no discussion taking place on the stage trying to decide  mine I am his teacher and we have we got along very well and I think he I think he got a B+ which is one of them  which is one of the highest grades I've ever given  I have no doubts about in commercial law one of the dollar subjects ever caught  and if  if we could get along in that we can get along and moderating and we will share these duties will be in constant consultation and we will  so it's good until pry weather  some co-hosting me even more than I him  bulshit  okay  okay we're good this is the format we're going to follow I've got one announcement to make and we're going to hear a short short statement from president Sutton and Chancellor Carter and then Keith Michael make short statements and I'm going to have a question and answer. - main concerns what happened this morning there were eight people that were arrested  outside Brian Hall and they were all charged with a misdemeanor disorderly conduct except for one who is also charged with disregarding a police signal now  Bond bond has been set at $50 we need $400 at least for Bond and we need more than that for our defense we've got one of the law professor starting on the case and you can look so far Professor showing horse you sound a lot of student problems he deserves a round of applause  so those of you who were asked a little bit earlier if you had motorcycle helmets will you either pass them around yourselves or will you give them to nearby Marshall's who have white shirts and green bands and the moral force of Marshall's course and while this whole thing is going on we can try and raise some money and get those kids out of jail and back here with us they weren't arrested fairly anyway  yeah he says not nickels and dimes we need some money off all the money is going to go to the student government defense fund we're going to use it for bailing and defenses for stuff that happens around here on campus okay president Sutton you want to start  first I wish to address myself to  I statement attributed to me  in various ways  in the in various newspapers  can you hear me sign attributed to me in various newspapers and none of this has to do with the speech which I ain't gave in Evansville Indiana now if you want to if you want to think that I'm I'm indulging you or anything I will tell you what happened briefly and then tell you what I actually said and in this connection  I went to Evansville Indiana to address an alumni group to talk about educational problems that I foresee in the year 2000  when I arrived while I'm in just bear with me please and and then you going to miss me when I'm finished  hate me now if you like but  when I arrived I found that there was apprehensive  I'm on a significant number of people attending that meeting about what was going on in Bloomington question usually gets put to me what the hell is going on in Bloomington  and so I address myself to that pointing out  that what the hell was going on in Bloomington and I'm summarizing here  I have a been peaceful  be had been the result of the concern of  not only young people who  are considered to be on the left if there is such a thing but young people clear across the spectrum of political opinion  and the thing that concerns them was the war and they were making a moral and peaceful protest to indicate their concern and in many cases their disdain for what was happening in Vietnam  I told him that  they had every reason to be proud of the students and the entire academic community of Indiana University this was for the summer and I didn't since I was giving an extemporaneous Lee I don't have any notes  there was a question and answer.  Are following me so I should also add that I stated that it was the policy agreed upon by the administration  that the university would remain open for those students who wish to attend  that those students who did not wish to attend and who felt some moral obligation to go out and do something else be at demonstrate or go back to their hometowns and talk to their elected representatives or their friends and neighbors and so on we're free to do so  and that  then there was this was followed by a question-and-answer period the question that elicited the unfortunate and conflicting  quotations was the question  would you under any circumstances close the University  and my answer to that was not that after I can't remember all the adjectives bloody Mayhem death and destruction Etc had occurred but that I would certainly close the university on my own initiative  if I felt that the lives of students faculty or citizens were endangered by any activity or if there was a threat at all possibilities of grave  damage to property  now that  is what I said and I want to get that cleared up  I was reported in one paper I want I won't get into that that there were conflicting reports about what I said but that is in fact not verbatim because I don't remember the vapor verbatim statement but that is what I said  now let me get on to the second part of my statement cuz I know that you will have a lot of questions that you will wish to raise but both myself and Chancellor Carter  I feel that my obligation and responsibility  is to provide an educational opportunity in the classroom for those students who wish such an opportunity  I do not feel  I therefore that I can close the university because these students who wish to attend classes and there are many thousands  have paid their fees and have every right to expect that what they paid for they will get  it's their bag as what they want to do it's what the institution was originally set up to do and that's my obligation on the other hand  on the other hand I do not feel  that those students who out of reasons of conscience  wish to go out and do something else providing it is does not interfere with the rights of others to do their thing should in any way be interfering with  and so long as  they do not interfere with the rights of others to do their thing I feel it is as much the obligation of the university to protect those  who doing something else as it is to protect those who attend class  Chancellor Carter  I'll try to keep can you hear me  I'll try to keep my comments relatively brief because they relax largely to a question of attitude relating to the two initially the student government demands which were made at the president sometime back on May one and then followed by a referendum run by the students on this item which also went faculty members and staff  that one set of Demands here and I want to speak to them very briefly the first a man presented was at the University repudiate President Nixon's plans for Southeast Asia and demand the immediate withdrawal  the drought has risen to its feet as  chocolate Carter read that one demand from the referendum  I'm in Mass without a chair it's obvious what your sentiment is  now these demands were presented to the president of the University I'm going to speak first as a faculty member not as a Chancellor have the president of this University made a statement in behalf of this University stating this kind of repudiation I would have moved Accenture and I would have moved it for a damn simple reason he's appointed as president to preside over the educational policy and direction of this institution not to make statements for those of us on the faculty or among the students with relation to foreign policy  I think  I happen to personally hold that view of the faculty as well the faculty is a corporate body concerns with scholarship and learning its function is different it has a large  it has a large number of Alternatives open for protest or demonstration at all kinds of matters which relate to political activities but not as a corporate body  number two was the end of Campus complicity in Southeast Asia and open the books of the IU Foundation to supply information on government contracts  the books of the IU foundations on government contracts have been open for years  it is very simple to get access to the records on government contracts of this University one or publish list which come out periodically identifying the contract secondly it is possible to examine the contract in the office of Dean Merritt the only thing that is withheld on the statement of the contracts is those sections of the budget which relate to the individual salaries of investigators this has been the case here for years and year after year we have had to repeat the same message the books on government contracts are open  number three with relation of the financial commitment to the Bobby seale defense fund is a simple time to answer  individual students faculty and others can make contributions to this defense fund it is illegal to take general fund money and make contributions of this kind I personally don't want to go to Michigan City right now  number for  doubt with bringing increasing the percentage of black students in the university in accordance with the percentage of the black people in the state of Indiana  I am I'm shocked that you apply why not Mueller  stop blunt  the blunt truth of the matter is that we have been working on increasing the number of black students in this University vice-chancellor Herman Hudson and I are going to try to further increase the number of black students I think there is a mythology here that you want to set photos you don't want to send photos you want to take people in an educator are you want to increase numbers we know that we have a smaller proportionate number of black students now than we had in the 1950s or intention is to do something about it and we've been meeting with a black student leaders on it  let's let him finish up what he has to say please we have met with the black student leaders on it  and we are working constructively at it  the alarm thing that ended on the on the referendum was to close the university the student vote was 9000 + 2 7000 plus yes  the faculty  what's three quarters plus no  the blunt truth of the matter is however why should the rights of those  who wish to go on be turned off by the fact of the majority rule I am not  come on can we have a little quiet please now  presidents are spoken before of our concern that those who really wish to withdraw from the classes and do other things of a constructive nature in relation to making their political position to know  that we are concerned to protect their rights I'm quite willing to say that I will I find the faculty Council resolution passed yesterday urging the faculty  to pay particular attention to this  and to take steps when they can to provide but academic penalties are not felt by the students there is however a meth in the system which I find start that administrators can issue orders to faculty about this they can and they never have been able to  before Keith in Mike's because I'd like to do one other thing I lied I'd like to read you the names of those people who were arrested and and tell you that if any of you know anything if you were witness if you were there if you know these people you saw something go to the student government office and write down on a piece of paper who you are where we can get in touch with see what you were doing what you were their names anything you can remember while I'm reading the names I'd like to invite president Sutton Chancellor cartoon mr. Pratt or to contribute to our fun  those those people arrested  currently president Sutton on Chancellor Carter have refused that invitations William Curley Paul Dobbs Susan young Gregory Hess Steve Emery Rodger Knowlton Mike Jones and John Cowles I hope we can all give him a moral in any kind of support you can give them  okay next speaker is vice president of student body Mike King  give me five. Just take a little time this is quite a bit of correction in addition to the minutes to be made  I want to talk first about prison Sutton statement  I said as soon as I can figure is is true all of the tone of a statement was a little different when it was read yesterday and I saw some things that he did leave out that I think people should know and we have contacted the Evansville press and they have told us that he can deny it all he wants but it's our word against his  this is this is from the Evansville press reporter  watch Justified to these notes that she took exact quote here that I you will remain open unless and I quote raid violence causing bodily harm or possible death and Grievous property damages forces me to close it  but it will be bloody Mayhem before I will close it and if I close it I will close it good and proper and this is something left out here salaries will cease and things will come to a standstill and it will stay closed till I'm good and ready to open it  I wasn't appointed president of the university to deny anybody the right to an education no matter how reasonable or how show to strike requested is Sade I will not permit it  no it's not  it's not only students that were a little upset about this statement  faculty were a little upset that there's so many first person pronouns here  but I think you some of the other things that were mentioned here during his talk a little instructor this from the Evansville Courier now under headline are you president determine to keep a school open  although there are a couple of students in the IU Student Government home setting admittedly doesn't like  he said the leaders so far I've asked students to a baby rules and avoid violence I can't believe it it may not last but it has up till up until now he said the IU students generally don't like the present Student Government whose leader calls himself a self-styled black panther militant  it goes on a talking about how the students ran Mark read off campus  and then it hits another section it's kind of useful and do the people arrested today he believes there are about and this was also in the hell telephone people can check on this to and you can check with the reporters  I believe that there are about 50 students NYU campus dedicated to Violent destructive Acts  who may be able to raise 200 to 400 more for additional support  the rest of fine young men and women who are concerned about the war and other problems now I want to point out that whoever those 50 students are dedicated to Violent destructive acts that are not uniform that they do not carry 4ft clubs they are not dressed up in riot gear that that they do not have  if you do not have to have tracks poison on the edge of town as was done last week by State Police and if anybody violence comes to this campus that's where it's going to come from  those police  he said he has heard talk to some of us some of the out-of-town students believe I believe if I use stays open it will break the national strike Sutton said there's no way of telling who are the out-of-town students luckily Bloomington is a small town and cannot accommodate many out-of-town people he said  knock knock before leaving to this next part I want to emphasize  that into meetings that Keith and I had with the president  and and you heard him say again today that he would not not make a statement on foreign policy  and at this time not even as an individual  because because he knew he knew  he knew that his name could not be dissociated from the fact that he was president of Indiana University that he made that statement the keys and I are twice and and he's been making it repeatedly  this is what occurred at the Evansville alumni mean according to the Evansville Courier  students have asked him to denounce the move into Cambodia  what's up man who lived in Thailand for three years as a special advisor to the government  said quote I don't even have a fax yet I'm a professional in this field and I cannot make a decision without the facts and quote and then and then the final statement of the article which is not a direct quote and we're trying to run down a direct quote he said however that he personally favors the move himself although he would not make such a statement as the IU president this after promising that he would never make such a statement  so that it is not a question here of a political University of versus politics invading University is the question I miss the sun's politics vs-560 people the University  finally I want to say that and you were the statement that Keith and I released yesterday at this meeting  is responsibility of many other concerned student I was I was home preparing for a class when I found out that the friends of mine have been arrested  I want to say that I want I was I was proud of those students taking a stand I was proud of the faculty taking a stand out there and I think it's about time to rest University takes stand  call moderator and I agreed that presidents often should have the opportunity to respond before mr. Parker makes his remarks  I did not say I I'm I made no  I made no comment procon on the present campaign in Cambodia  we're going to get two questions in a second we have we have one more speaker man whose conduct is it has been exemplary in the past weekend  president of your student body Keith Parker  the audience is once again rising to its Beach and it's waiting to see if Parker there can sitting quietly what is Edge of the table set up on the stage  how to price is right on  what I have to say when I take my time because I think I might have said enough and I've said enough in the past and I think now how many of you have things to say to the closer you know what needs to be set in a very important also I like to speak first to one part of the demands the demand on Bobby seale and we never said money would be taken out the general fine you know what implements is we said that means be made to raise money  now think of Indiana no matter how beautiful they maybe I'm not good at the point where they can relate to tipping in the Bobby civil defense fund  now so this is why we we understood this clearly from the start and heading our heads if he means to raise money now in terms of the statement that Mike and I made yesterday and I said you know that's it well if Mike and I have three policemen that we might as well move into Brian Hall but I was speaking in terms of was that I think and I say this enough times that are Mike and I are going to have to do all these jobs on campus their offices might as well be in the president's office and Brian 200  and if  and I'll say it again it if those offices were up for election Mike and I would run for those two  so the purpose the purpose of people being here today  is the Once  run what is on their minds directly to those people who should have some answers everyone has to understand this everyone has to understand that you do have a right to speak out there's no one can deny you this right  and if the rights of those who want to attend classes are to be protected the rights of those who want to speak out must be protected  so I don't want to take up too much more time but I'm going to say is that I'm still on strike  into those beautiful people at Brian and it Valentine and all around today all power to the people  you're listening to live coverage of the student Administration for him when I'll pause 10 seconds for station identification  are the four microphones on  do they have enough lead to carry him back to people without questions being accepted from the floor  you'll have your chance  okay principally this was to be a question-and-answer session for president Sutton and Chancellor Carter so if we could keep to that everybody here would appreciate it and I know they're right in the front in the middle  my question is the people who are leading the strike with all this glorious rhetoric about respecting people's right I'm wondering seriously what action is to be taken by the student government that is obviously leading the strike to stop people from pushing people which is the salt and Battery understand pushing people pushing bricks of people and closing doors. This is a violation of right I like to know what's going to be.  okay Mike  yeah as far as the strike today goes you have to talk to people that were running to strike that we're on strike lines I was not a student government was not long ago but I want to stay a little bit about the  I want to say that I was picking on Friday and I was up pushed around and shoved around and assaulted around is as you know these as as much as calves were by scabs going through the line  I think  I think that you know  can we give her the microphone and let her know that she won't she wants to sharpen the question  answer to this question you are demanding that the administration give answers your demanding that the administration give action that I'd like some action that prevents my kind of class  I'd like to hold this mic and represent the people who have not been heard from until I get an answer for action  just keep on this issue all right or he's one at a time  as we clearly said picket lines are picket lines will be fine by the picketers we do not have individual strings whenever you pick it up we made it clear we made it clear they would you be defined by such that we call broken picket line of people decided they believe strong enough to close those lines it is their choice and that's all I have to say  Chancellor Carter will respond with you and that I hope if you have these difficulties I don't think they can hear us know the truth of the matter is I do not see how in the name of acts against repression  you repress people but it seems to me that this has happened on some of the worst pick-up lines  in the in the yellow shirt  behind you  can somebody pass him a Mike  I don't know know about the factual premises wrong do you want to rephrase your question  yes  the question has been answered  India  I called on him you'll be next  just so you won't think I'm ducking the issue  I will tell you this at the last Bloomington council meeting this this policy is decided campus by campus and we have seven  Health Alliance Bloomington campus meeting in the Bloomington faculty Council  took action and made a recommendation to the faculty at Large  and I will know I do not oppose this recommendation  as a matter of fact is quite in accordance  with academic tradition as I have known it now Chancellor Carter I'll give you the details if you would allow him to do so  quickly what was passed was a resolution which essentially are urged that faculty pay serious attention to finding means by which students would not suffer under arcademic penalties for participation in political protests are going back home and some people at the top two people the options on this are not spelled out in the resolution because the various divisions of the Bloomington campus have different kinds of rule patterns on parts of their grades the College of Arts and Sciences policy committee as I understand already made some suggestions connecting that there's the Law School faculty was prepared to meet on this today I think the business School faculty is about to lay down our various Alternatives but I think you make a different things developed in different prices obviously the incomplete is one with a deferred examination that might be a possibility it's easy to do finances  San Pasqual relationships may be done as eyesight there are there various options that are open  but it is up to the individual faculty member to accept the recommendations which come to him because braiding pack dresses around here have always stayed with individual faculty member  Chuck Turner was next to ask and the first one has to do with non-violence this campus and I like to know who is responsible for calling police on this campus  we have we have it from a hooker that to someone in administration by police on this campus is that truth no matter who called the police on this campus  I am responsible  because I'm president of Indiana University hey can we can we let Chuck ask you a question  this car is great sermon on campus that much responsibility for what bounce there what was it did occur today had to do with the presence of police is well known that the presence of uniformed officers tend to incite situations and we'd like to know  we like we like to have your assurance that the police will not be calling on the campus again for just this reason  if you will give me insurance  and then I don't care you can pick it all you want to  but if you prevent people from going about their appointed tasks and do not allow them to to do this and  after I patiently waited for several hours and don't think this isn't going to going to have some backlash  you are requested to vacate the doorways and I am told informed that they could go to a formal open picketing  to protect the lives the property of yours and mine by second  Mr Turner still has the bike my second question has to do with ROTC  more than a year ago the awesome science there was a committee has a division of Arts and Sciences which was composed of factly students as I understand which turn report in which favored the position that no credit should be given for ROTC work at that time at that time and all University accounts committee was appointed as I understand by it by yourself at that time ago when I look what came in and all University committee was appointed and I have it that that committee has turned in a report to you that you have access to the finals of that committee and a  the battery port is gone to the faculty Council for his consideration and recommendation  the recommendation was to I don't remember the details but what you want to know is did they recommend did they recommend the abolition of all DC or not and then answer is they did not what about credit for OTC credit  mr. Can I speak to one point because the Arts and Science report a year ago did not say no credit for ROTC why didn't they make a recommendation to the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences not work in ROTC should not count with in that portion of the students total program that must be taken within the College of Arts and Sciences it does price that in the same category as some of the other courses and professional schools that it could be taken but within the maximum allowed by the College of Arts and Sciences to that point it did not propose any immediate ending of credit and had some long run proposals about ROTC to be phased over a. Of time  it was sent to an all University, date because ROTC is relevant not only to the faculty of the college and the students within the college but to all other students within the various divisions that one last quick question then I'll release my I like to know if all the IU books are open to public and including sources and uses of funds  and if not why not  there is there is a  there is a m  public accounting of all University  use of funds made to the state of Indiana  and those become public documents and therefore are open what about the foundation  the foundation is on it annually by a firm from outside the institution and the report of an Autumn it is available in the foundation office  people I'm representing Veterans for peace and certain students at the law school  these are not ordinary times this has not been an ordinary week and I don't think that ordinary responses from the administration are appropriate  I think that the situation which Indiana University finds itself in today demands an extraordinary response  I made turn some of you off but I want to say very clearly that I do not support close picket lines but if those lines were not closed this morning we would not be here today  once again the audience is rising to its Peach showing at solidarity at least on this point  Danvers is being a student Amanda only met by confrontation  now I don't know how many to read the daily student this morning but I had a long-ass day and which was which was titled at the top don't shut down the university if any of you if any of you read further than the title you will see that the important part of that recommendation of that essay was the recommendation not the title  my recommendation was basically the Yale plan which only makes Planet just a second it was given to Chancellor Carter a personal copy yesterday and to Dean Harvey personal copy yesterday and all of you who read the students this morning had an opportunity to see it I do not believe because of my deep end grain civil libertarian principles having lived in the South for many years  I do not believe in unbridled majority rule I do believe in preservation of the rights of the minority and therefore I don't think that the university should be closed down for everyone  I think that it should it should continue and existence business as usual for those who want it that way  where do I finish but just saying as Administration has made a pass at so far that there was that they will attempt to protect the rights of those who don't agree it's not enough  I understand completely that the that the University Administration cannot order the faculty to do anything and I wouldn't have it any other way but I think they can clearly make their feelings known that they agree with a recommendation to each individual School  to each individual school to handle any way they see fit to allow those of us who want to go out in the community who want to go to Washington who want to speak write Lobby in our own way or do more constructive things during the next three weeks and take exams to do so and it should be a clear recommendation from both the president and the chancellor that classes will be waived exams will be waived and credit will be given automatically  I do not believe in the productivity of interfering with the rights of those who've sometimes for very sound pragmatic reasons are here at Great personal expense either to themselves or to others I think they should be able to continue to go to class and continue to take exams and but I think that the university has an obligation  taken within the broadest possible context of what's been going on in the country in the last 10 days to see this step as an extraordinary step perhaps for this state and this Administration but as a very minor step taken when we consider the alternative  and I think they have an obligation to say yes while I would not ordinarily do so these are extraordinary times and I recommend to the entrance to the other school leaders that they do that they do exactly this  I have the highest regard for this man from working with him. He spent 12 years in the Air Force resigns commission last year because it was ethically unjustifiable  and he's president of the student body of a law class and he's a member with me of the Veterans for peace  we got a reply from Chancellor Carter's Mr Boyle I thought I had already said but in my judgment  that I personally favored the recommendation made by The Faculty Council yesterday which went straight in the direction which is indicated I think by this last part of the comments I'm sorry I hadn't but I've been a little busy  announcement will make about the students or arrest  I'm Chris Norman from The English Department & Tom Show and Horace and Shelly Geller and Peter didn't bomb and I just came from the jail the eight people who are arrested are out of state  they have been arraigned on $50 Bond and released on $50 bail piece is $400 the bail money was raised by the faculty  Honda  but there's one very important point about this and it's only because of the crowded conditions that Tom shortest isn't talking to you because we didn't told one of March down here Tom is very concerned, represents the H stones in cord from now on  and Tom is very much concerned that you all know  that the judge made a particular effort and we mean this quite seriously to set the bonds as low as possible  they could have been at $500 a piece with the idea that  there is going to be some reciprocation to this from our part  that in other words the implication was quite clear  that if anybody's going to be busted tonight it's not going to be $50 it's going to be 500 a piece  we all know that but  all I can say is I don't think we can raise $500 a piece for number of students from now so I hope you all keep this in mind thank you  are we kind of the money backstage and we were able to collect $446.18  since those balances within bailed out I think it would be beneficial for us to put this into a Permanent Fund because this little ideas run around in my head is not to be used again if I like to make one more announcement about the teacher in tonight 7 p.m. right here you know an auditorium in the main speakers to be a professor stand miswak on containment of Vietnam Professor Edwards sermon on American servicemen indo-chinese War Professor Julius Gatlin Vietnam and political dissent Professor George Juergen's domestic Minister of Vietnam  and keys Parker the Black Panthers and flick repression therapy workshops to follow and then they'll be a wrap-up session in the auditorium after workshops  promise the gentleman who asked the first question that he would be recognized later and I do so now  I just keep shouting or repeat your question  silent majority please stop the speaker finish  please let the speaker finish  please  please please reach please reach the point of your question  I just  the TV on just a minute please the issue of the rights of those who want to go to class of and raised by several speakers have been responded to I don't think that particular statement all these more comments we will not recognize other question  I'm not an expert on what the people feel  because I know they feel  can we let the president's out and finish the answer please  because I know they feel many things  but if you're  question is to me do I respect people's feelings and thereby  let me see how to put that  no I am not afraid of afraid of the backlash  icon with microphone this whole topic keeps coming back up about the vote and what it meant for the referendum and I still don't think the question was really answered a moment ago you said there would be recommendations about a students who had voted to descent or voted to strike you said there would be recommendations made and there the same time was the statement by the yellow Professor who said these are extraordinary times  in view of the fact that they are and you can guarantee people's rights to go to class why cannot you guarantee the rights of those people who wish to dissent  no this is Radio Bloomington campus matter  why he knows he's willing to talk to but I want to try to answer this as directly as I can answer because I was there at the council discussion and he was not  because it's a Bloomington faculty Council and I preside and he's not a member  I'm out Mike may I answer the question I think basically what I've tried to get across before is the administration is not authorized to make these decisions by itself what happened was the council recommended this kind of thing to do the faculty is a whole what is happening is that in division after division as far as I get reports they are taking it up as I said I think the arts arts and sciences College already has tried to deal with this through its elected policy committee and the law school is meeting I know the business school is planning to meet but I can't reach in  and tell them what they must do I can do what I said earlier and express a sentiment of Sympathy for the position but they're going to have to do it today but I would like to also ask in connection with that is this a democratic Institution  and if it is so called and how can those two ideas be reconciled is it a corporate interest or institution and do you reconcile corporate interests with democratic ideals and principles or are they separate  there was a vote and recommend referendum taken here and the majority of the students voted that's that's Democratic I always thought it was  this is a very difficult and profound question that's raised democracy is not so simple that its dimensions are self-evident the question about the boat is a question of what belongs on the agenda do you want by majority vote to strip the people of their constitutional rights the whole point of a democracy is that it has limits the whole point of a democracy or a constitutional protections for certain minorities as an educated people as people are attempting to understand our society we must begin to understand what we mean by democracy in a more complicated way then all questions are resolved okay  there are issues as to what items can be put on the agenda the answers along the line of every question is been the we are trying to walk a path we are trying to develop programs that do protect the rights of the students who have dissented the rights of the students who feel incapable of taking exams I just came from a lost to a meeting where we have special constraints on how much we can relieve our students and we are struggling with this problem I know that I asked in science we can at least agree that we cannot take action when the campus is seriously split in the student boat by Amir majority vote principal we can adjust matters and terms of grades and credits has been suggested that will do justice to that's the point of this meeting we have made and an impact on how many does how many of the students feel strongly that this University cannot barely continue we have shown we have  fun things and we can do it without creating bitterness in those who perhaps don't feel that on these issues their their rights can be compromised by the majority I miss the predator  I would like to like to ask you know as a moderator you know how you're running all this cuz a moderator should be sitting here pointing out people to ask questions and I running all these comments  and then I have one more I have one more question to ask myself it's in two parts although president setting is assumed responsibility for it for asking for the police to come who was the person that called the police who was this person and second of all why are we sitting up here on the stage with a various members of that same police force behind us  armed to the gills  you want to handle that one  let's say I called him  just a minute I was carried away I apologize I did it in the best interest of trying to reach understanding  to compensate for by default I'll ask my moderator if he wants equal time  my question was answered me once before now let me tell you this and I know  I know that you're everything I say about this however reasonable it seems to me is going to meet with some kind of hostility response on the part of you automatically  playing Safety Division of Indiana University is train  are we don't want to hear the answer to just forget it  are trained and an instructed  to protect  the limes  let's let's let the man finish at least I mean you don't have to like what he says but let him get it out  but they are trained and advised and instructed  to be as sensitive  and as careful in the protection of your lives as they can be  Harmon  the Harvey report is being implemented as rapidly as it can be implemented  I want no air again are you want it here it like it is  I do not at this time plan to recommend that the guns be removed from the police force  you ask me the question I answered it  I like to ask a question pertaining to the so-called quote-unquote neutrality of this University I'm sure president something is aware since he was there for three years of what is Unity this University does in the Thailand project and I like to throw a few fast at about that time and has not had a free election in 28 years since University 1.3 million dollars to send people over to Thailand to train people over in Thailand now as far as the question of Roxy is concerned if you check out the clothes of military leaders of this country they say the United States government could not wage war or whatever they call it an overseas test if it wasn't for the ROTC 70% of officers in the United States Army in Vietnam or ROTC graduate now if you people are wrapped up in his civil liberties thing about all this  right on but I think this the civil liberties of the Vietnamese people and a Cambodian people to live without being a pound on by American Apparel us is more important  it's going to rain here please  do you want to respond it's all right did you ask me a question about Thailand all right  I will be glad to answer the question the contracts between the university and Thailand during the parade that I was there and subsequent to my return to this country is available and you may read it  purpose purpose there was twofold  one school of education was developing a College of Education to train teachers for  the children of time and throughout the country and open new schools and that you can see in the contract  well I don't need it if they get educated  please ask what we were doing and you  if you want me to answer I will complete the answer and then again and do your own thing  the other the other part, right  I'm trying to you finished the others part of the contract wants to train young administrators to go out into the country side of Thailand much almost all almost all the Grand and provide better service to and these are all civilians better service to The Peasants and the people of the Thailand itself  I recognize the German right in time I know all I know about it I can  how do I mean a question a serious one or not I currently Indiana University is in a Consortium venue Michigan State University University of Minnesota  Indiana yes they're all big ten schools  I can't remember all I'm off hand but they are being financed  to help these are all professors of economic statistics at cetera agricultural economics and so far  kind of this contract is financed by the Ford foundation for the purposes of developing something known as the National Institute of development Administration the purpose of an is described by the name  I have the kind of government when I was there that had more school teachers than it had soldiers  the gentleman like with brown hair  quiet please  again for some of you this answer will not be satisfactory  but I will admit that I should have done that and I didn't do it  no I was not afraid  if I was afraid I'm here I'll come on knock it off any if you want to just  I mean if you want to buy Jamaica we could go out, I thought we were trying to get questions answered and I'm answering the question I made a mistake that's all I'm fallible and I confess to it  accountability has met with students and they asked why he did not have a big question for Chancellor Carter I believe that this question can also be answered yes or no  and first of all it's my understanding that also besides being Chancellor that you are faculty member is that correct  I hope so because that's all I've got tenure as well then would you respond  would you respond under the understanding that you are responding as a faculty member this institution and not as its Chancellor to a question  depends on the question I'll ask the question you would have heard the area plan presented I believe do you understand it  if you mean this thing the my question is that I think it can be answered yes or no as a faculty member this institution with the understanding that you are not responding as Chancellor but as a faculty member with you endorse the Yale plan  we're going to give Chancellor Carter a few minutes to read it over  the brown right in front yo  request Iowa.  All right now  everybody everybody in this place is getting a little pissed but could I have your attention for just a minute please. Everybody's just a little bit tense and my Greek blood is running a little hot to and it doesn't mean I'm in a fraternity  all right  now let's quit throwing the bullshit around and quit you no running around this little porch because you know if there's an issue you see and this issue comes up in front of this issue, lot of little issue in all these people get pissed about these little things like your watch CBS you know and you see these construction guys getting all uptight and some girl up here stands up and she's getting uptight cuz she's getting pushed around but the issue is troops went into Cambodia the issue is people are being killed right now that's the issue we're spending a war that is a diversion stuff to make people in the back wrist of people up in the front that's how it is that's a diversion that's bullshit that's politics there's a lot of piss people all right mr. Sutton you represent this University all right and then you said this before okay just nine thousand people in this University that are pissed enough to  show up to the polls and that does include your 12000 40% of the people United States didn't vote for the president  all right I'll wait a minute let me finish this up all right now you're responsible now there's 9000 people that are pissed enough to say we want something done and then there's some other people that are pissed it off so they say can I get this question all right now  all right I mean the figure of speech right okay  all right  this is for most you people are pissed at me in the back  I can shove you any picket line please sir I want your help and now I want mr. Sutton's help and I want your help what are you going to do with us there's 9000 people if not more what will you do know we're talking about our lives mr. people are going to graduate and they're going to have to go over to Cambodia what will you do to help us thank you but you come to attention  all right  mr. Sutton mr. Sutton whether you can't you cannot get away from it more than your president of this University or not you're a person and this thing about that my job doesn't enable me to fill into app is a lot of bulshit man that's a lot of major point we know you made your point now that's it  why I feel as a human being is this and again  I know I'm going to get it  please  I'll tell you exactly my individual history of feeling toward the war  in 1958 when I returned from Thailand  I was greatly concerned with what I had seen  as an almost unconscious policy commitment to a military buildup in Southeast Asia that was going to lead your major ground war  I made those statements in public and in Prince and I made those that observation to as many people as I could contact as an assistant professor without tenure at this institution  however  I also felt that no adequate explanation  explaining to the American people  ain't that this was in the offing and be its precise purposes was ever made  nor has it been made in my judgment  now that is not the same I don't know I want to let me finish my thought here  please  that's about the size of it I guess that's the that's the way I felt now  why are my views in 1970 have not changed  want it but one of those things all right all right have fun  one of the things that bugs me if you want to know how I feel  is it there is an assumption on the part of a good many people in this country  that Asia and Africa and the near East is a matter of no relevance  they constantly concerned themselves primarily with European policy  it is a matter it is inevitable in my judgment  that if we do not build meaningful and peaceful relations between the peoples of Asia and Africa all right hahaha that's funny built the relations Bill peaceful relations with these people  that we want to eventually be destroyed by our own fatelessness  but I am not going to take an Institutional stand on the Cambodian War  just ladies on ladies and gentlemen originally when we started I said we would run for an hour we've already run for a just a minute we've already run for an hour and 20 minutes will run until 5:30 and I want to recognize the balcony the German right over the sign there  I'm sorry I couldn't see you before yes go  if it's with me if it a question was Princeton allows people to go home two weeks before the campaign to help campaign for their congressman is that not correct  I had I would have no objection to that policy whatsoever  if it if it if it were recommended by The Who control the curriculum and the courses then I went doing I don't shake your head because that's the essence of the University  but I would have no objection to it and and that's that's my answer as a member of The Faculty Council I think there's a very good chance that this issue I have discussed this issue with other people I think there is a great deal of support this is not this is more important than the immediate issue if we're going to end franchise the students if we're going to reduce the Boating age to 18 if we're going to recognize that they're away from their communities and cannot legitimately participate this is the best thing that's come along and education since going home to harvest the crops  I would like to tell you that yesterday at the faculty action committee I made a proposal which may help to answer the question that was raised that wasn't addressed to be on the proposal I made was to suggest to the political science department that they offer a course  which would make it possible for students say to come hear the details have to be worked out to come here for two or three weeks were very intensive session at the beginning of the term to study the campaigning practices etcetera Etc been for the students to be able to go out into the field for 6 weeks until election day as a practical experience campaign in their home communities or here in Monroe County work for the candidate that choice and to get political signs credit for this and then to continue their education the second half of the  what we're going to have a a response from Chancellor Carter on mr. Levy question on the Yale plan  I don't have any objection to the Yale plan of the faculty of a division will adopted  let it let me add one other thing on let me add one other thing on the light speaker it used to be  that they political science department then known as Government made arrangements of the kind that are being proposed here I can start remembering the campaigns of 1952 and a 1956 that was available I do want to add one little thing about Princeton because I think everybody is now getting excited and pleased with him  I think my Princeton is done is to take two of its reading weeks and move them up in front and is not changing its class contact hours  what be before the next question will you pass the motorcycle helmets are people can't ride around the state without them they'll get busted  the answer is they can  call riding that they don't interfere with those students that want to go  all right I have a question of a gentleman in the wings I'm sorry  I'm sorry  as I've said many times that you know it's more important to help somebody going to make some money in the bar as his case is going to do is maybe you to make some money and not help anyone if something's wrong so brother I'm staying right on what you're saying if you could come down to sitting here you know something these classes reading books about job that happened in 1440 and people are dying in 1970 and we can do something about it I'm going to be out there doing  going to be two more questions and I recognized first the gentleman in the wings  all right  I'd like to ask him moral question for to the structure of this University a few people in the audience have been directing moral questions to the speakers and I've been getting practical rational legalistic and government istic type answers back the man here asked the most obvious pertinent question what are these people going to do to help us the nine thousand of us that voted to strike and I'd like a answer to that  is anyone choose the answer that I don't have no money we will protect you and we will protect your right to strike we have said that we are sympathetic to the idea of trying to work out no academic penalty  I think what we're doing is we're going over the same damn tape to counterbalance the professors that are cutting our grades because they intimidate Us in class because we don't believe in the world and I had a guy had a great cut a whole letter because I disagreed with the professor in which is his right I wasn't intimidating him and I'm not intimidating you because I don't want to do that and I don't want violence but what I do want to know his hat who has the authority to say that the professor's that won't let us take it pass fail won't give us a credit not because of who we are but but what for what we believe in they just disagree with us who was got the authority to force them to let us have our like the 9000 we want to know  who are the park  I suppose the interesting thing on this and you're not going to like it is nobody has the power  what about the Board of Trustees if we can prove that those individuals professors are being prejudiced against us because of our stars yes you can find mechanisms usually usually like you can start through departmental chairman or Dean's who are not things I've had her being dolphin  please  I want  I have one more question people who are standing up there the complaining to haven't been recognized in the back yes  so it went in the back against them  only an academic officer  where am I at this is generally defined to me and academic vice president or Chancellor  are you Safety Division is not authorized  well and somebody authorized  yes  somebody really authorized that I did  understatement to make while we're here in this meeting whatever it is there's someone downtown in the courtroom now being arraigned in court for a charge of excessive noise the fact that a lot of you people heard the PA system going today well we were running this and I was in the backseat speaking in garyville was driving and we were stopped by it and no less than Forest police cars who started to search the car and wouldn't ask us when one answer a straight question as to what was wrong they just ignored us attempted to search the car to find anything they could just drop the announcement of his rally tonight I want you to know that and now they arrested Gary and he's downtown at court  why I have two questions make them quick please. I have two questions though one what why why do we have to get stop by for state policeman on a trumped-up charge obviously and to where were the cameras please why why why why why were the staple eye4 cars out there  I don't know about the health center  I know nothing about it I did not call any state police  ladies ladies and gentlemen we have exceeded even the time that I thought was suitable  thank you I thank you for your attention  I hope that we have lost our they might pull up we going to hang  the whole play  and so in a tumult this afternoon's program draws to a rather shattering conclusion the mics have been cut on stage and students are still attempting to  speak to the crowd assembled this 4000 + crowd with reportedly another few thousand outside the beginning facilities were made available so that those could view a television  report of this in other parts of the campus speaking on this evenings of this afternoon's program  Harry Potter a professor of Law and Del Prado
